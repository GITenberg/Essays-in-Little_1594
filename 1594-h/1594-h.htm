<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>Of the following essays, five are new, and were written for
this volume.&nbsp; They are the paper on Mr. R. L. Stevenson, the
&ldquo;Letter to a Young Journalist,&rdquo; the study of Mr.
Kipling, the note on Homer, and &ldquo;The Last Fashionable
Novel.&rdquo;&nbsp; The article on the author of &ldquo;Oh, no!
we never mention Her,&rdquo; appeared in the New York <i>Sun</i>,
and was suggested by Mr. Dana, the editor of that journal.&nbsp;
The papers on Thackeray and Dickens were published in <i>Good
Words</i>, that on Dumas appeared in <i>Scribner&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>, that on M. Th&eacute;odore de Banville in <i>The
New Quarterly Review</i>.&nbsp; The other essays were originally
written for a newspaper &ldquo;Syndicate.&rdquo;&nbsp; They have
been re-cast, augmented, and, to a great extent, re-written.</p>

<h2>ALEXANDRE DUMAS</h2>
<p>Alexandre Dumas is a writer, and his life is a topic, of which
his devotees never weary.&nbsp; Indeed, one lifetime is not long
enough wherein to tire of them.&nbsp; The long days and years of
Hilpa and Shalum, in Addison&mdash;the antediluvian age, when a
picnic lasted for half a century and a courtship for two hundred
years, might have sufficed for an exhaustive study of
Dumas.&nbsp; No such study have I to offer, in the brief seasons
of our perishable days.&nbsp; I own that I have not read, and do
not, in the circumstances, expect to read, all of Dumas, nor even
the greater part of his thousand volumes.&nbsp; We only dip a cup
in that sparkling spring, and drink, and go on,&mdash;we cannot
hope to exhaust the fountain, nor to carry away with us the well
itself.&nbsp; It is but a word of gratitude and delight that we
can say to the heroic and indomitable master, only an <i>ave</i>
of friendship that we can call across the bourne to the shade of
the Porthos of fiction.&nbsp; That his works (his best works)
should be even still more widely circulated than they are; that
the young should read them, and learn frankness, kindness,
generosity&mdash;should esteem the tender heart, and the gay,
invincible wit; that the old should read them again, and find
forgetfulness of trouble, and taste the anodyne of dreams, that
is what we desire.</p>
<p>Dumas said of himself (&ldquo;M&eacute;moires,&rdquo; v. 13)
that when he was young he tried several times to read forbidden
books&mdash;books that are sold <i>sous le manteau</i>.&nbsp; But
he never got farther than the tenth page, in the</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;scrofulous French
novel<br />
On gray paper with blunt type;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he never made his way so far as</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;the woful sixteenth print.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I had, thank God, a natural sentiment of delicacy; and
thus, out of my six hundred volumes (in 1852) there are not four
which the most scrupulous mother may not give to her
daughter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Much later, in 1864, when the
<i>Censure</i> threatened one of his plays, he wrote to the
Emperor: &ldquo;Of my twelve hundred volumes there is not one
which a girl in our most modest quarter, the Faubourg
Saint-Germain, may not be allowed to read.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
mothers of the Faubourg, and mothers in general, may not take
Dumas exactly at his word.&nbsp; There is a passage, for example,
in the story of Miladi (&ldquo;Les Trois Mousquetaires&rdquo;)
which a parent or guardian may well think undesirable reading for
youth.&nbsp; But compare it with the original passage in the
&ldquo;M&eacute;moires&rdquo; of D&rsquo;Artagnan!&nbsp; It has
passed through a medium, as Dumas himself declared, of natural
delicacy and good taste.&nbsp; His enormous popularity, the
widest in the world of letters, owes absolutely nothing to
prurience or curiosity.&nbsp; The air which he breathes is a
healthy air, is the open air; and that by his own choice, for he
had every temptation to seek another kind of vogue, and every
opportunity.</p>
<p>Two anecdotes are told of Dumas&rsquo; books, one by M. Edmond
About, the other by his own son, which show, in brief space, why
this novelist is so beloved, and why he deserves our affection
and esteem.&nbsp; M. Villaud, a railway engineer who had lived
much in Italy, Russia, and Spain, was the person whose enthusiasm
finally secured a statue for Dumas.&nbsp; He felt so much
gratitude to the unknown friend of lonely nights in long exiles,
that he could not be happy till his gratitude found a permanent
expression.&nbsp; On returning to France he went to consult M.
Victor Borie, who told him this tale about George Sand.&nbsp; M.
Borie chanced to visit the famous novelist just before her death,
and found Dumas&rsquo; novel, &ldquo;Les Quarante Cinq&rdquo;
(one of the cycle about the Valois kings) lying on her
table.&nbsp; He expressed his wonder that she was reading it for
the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the first time!&mdash;why, this is the fifth or
sixth time I have read &lsquo;Les Quarante Cinq,&rsquo; and the
others.&nbsp; When I am ill, anxious, melancholy, tired,
discouraged, nothing helps me against moral or physical troubles
like a book of Dumas.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, M. About says that M.
Sarcey was in the same class at school with a little Spanish
boy.&nbsp; The child was homesick; he could not eat, he could not
sleep; he was almost in a decline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to see your mother?&rdquo; said young
Sarcey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No: she is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No: he used to beat me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brothers and sisters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why are you so eager to be back in
Spain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To finish a book I began in the holidays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what was its name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Los Tres Mosqueteros&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was homesick for &ldquo;The Three Musketeers,&rdquo; and
they cured him easily.</p>
<p>That is what Dumas does.&nbsp; He gives courage and life to
old age, he charms away the half-conscious <i>nostalgie</i>, the
<i>Heimweh</i>, of childhood.&nbsp; We are all homesick, in the
dark days and black towns, for the land of blue skies and brave
adventures in forests, and in lonely inns, on the battle-field,
in the prison, on the desert isle.&nbsp; And then Dumas comes,
and, like Argive Helen, in Homer, he casts a drug into the wine,
the drug nepenthe, &ldquo;that puts all evil out of
mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; Does any one suppose that when George Sand was
old and tired, and near her death, she would have found this
anodyne, and this stimulant, in the novels of M. Tolsto&iuml;, M.
Dostoiefsky, M. Zola, or any of the &ldquo;scientific&rdquo;
observers whom we are actually requested to hail as the masters
of a new art, the art of the future?&nbsp; Would they make her
laugh, as Chicot does? make her forget, as Porthos, Athos, and
Aramis do? take her away from the heavy, familiar time, as the
enchanter Dumas takes us?&nbsp; No; let it be enough for these
new authors to be industrious, keen, accurate,
<i>pr&eacute;cieux</i>, pitiful, charitable, veracious; but give
us high spirits now and then, a light heart, a sharp sword, a
fair wench, a good horse, or even that old Gascon rouncy of
D&rsquo;Artagnan&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Like the good Lord James Douglas,
we had liefer hear the lark sing over moor and down, with Chicot,
than listen to the starved-mouse squeak in the <i>bouge</i> of
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Raquin, with M. Zola.&nbsp; Not that there
is not a place and an hour for him, and others like him; but they
are not, if you please, to have the whole world to themselves,
and all the time, and all the praise; they are not to turn the
world into a dissecting-room, time into tedium, and the laurels
of Scott and Dumas into crowns of nettles.</p>
<p>There is no complete life of Alexandre Dumas.&nbsp; The age
has not produced the intellectual athlete who can gird himself up
for that labour.&nbsp; One of the worst books that ever was
written, if it can be said to be written, is, I think, the
English attempt at a biography of Dumas.&nbsp; Style, grammar,
taste, feeling, are all bad.&nbsp; The author does not so much
write a life as draw up an indictment.&nbsp; The spirit of his
work is grudging, sneering, contemptuous, and pitifully
peddling.&nbsp; The great charge is that Dumas was a humbug, that
he was not the author of his own books, that his books were
written by &ldquo;collaborators&rdquo;&mdash;above all, by M.
Maquet.&nbsp; There is no doubt that Dumas had a regular system
of collaboration, which he never concealed.&nbsp; But whereas
Dumas could turn out books that <i>live</i>, whoever his
assistants were, could any of his assistants write books that
live, without Dumas?&nbsp; One might as well call any barrister
in good practice a thief and an impostor because he has juniors
to &ldquo;devil&rdquo; for him, as make charges of this kind
against Dumas.&nbsp; He once asked his son to help him; the
younger Alexandre declined.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is worth a thousand a
year, and you have only to make objections,&rdquo; the sire
urged; but the son was not to be tempted.&nbsp; Some excellent
novelists of to-day would be much better if they employed a
friend to make objections.&nbsp; But, as a rule, the collaborator
did much more.&nbsp; Dumas&rsquo; method, apparently, was first
to talk the subject over with his <i>aide-de-camp</i>.&nbsp; This
is an excellent practice, as ideas are knocked out, like sparks
(an elderly illustration!), by the contact of minds.&nbsp; Then
the young man probably made researches, put a rough sketch on
paper, and supplied Dumas, as it were, with his
&ldquo;brief.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Dumas took the
&ldquo;brief&rdquo; and wrote the novel.&nbsp; He gave it life,
he gave it the spark (<i>l&rsquo;&eacute;tincelle</i>); and the
story lived and moved.</p>
<p>It is true that he &ldquo;took his own where he found
it,&rdquo; like Mol&egrave;re and that he took a good deal.&nbsp;
In the gallery of an old country-house, on a wet day, I came once
on the &ldquo;M&eacute;moires&rdquo; of D&rsquo;Artagnan, where
they had lain since the family bought them in Queen Anne&rsquo;s
time.&nbsp; There were our old friends the Musketeers, and there
were many of their adventures, told at great length and
breadth.&nbsp; But how much more vivacious they are in
Dumas!&nbsp;&nbsp; M. About repeats a story of Dumas and his ways
of work.&nbsp; He met the great man at Marseilles, where, indeed,
Alexandre chanced to be &ldquo;on with the new love&rdquo; before
being completely &ldquo;off with the old.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dumas
picked up M. About, literally lifted him in his embrace, and
carried him off to see a play which he had written in three
days.&nbsp; The play was a success; the supper was prolonged till
three in the morning; M. About was almost asleep as he walked
home, but Dumas was as fresh as if he had just got out of
bed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go to sleep, old man,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I,
who am only fifty-five, have three <i>feuilletons</i> to write,
which must be posted to-morrow.&nbsp; If I have time I shall
knock up a little piece for Montigny&mdash;the idea is running in
my head.&rdquo;&nbsp; So next morning M. About saw the three
<i>feuilletons</i> made up for the post, and another packet
addressed to M. Montigny: it was the play <i>L&rsquo;Invitation
&agrave; la Valse</i>, a chef-d&rsquo;oeuvre!&nbsp; Well, the
material had been prepared for Dumas.&nbsp; M. About saw one of
his novels at Marseilles in the chrysalis.&nbsp; It was a stout
copy-book full of paper, composed by a practised hand, on the
master&rsquo;s design.&nbsp; Dumas copied out each little leaf on
a big leaf of paper, <i>en y semant l&rsquo;esprit &agrave;
pleines mains</i>.&nbsp; This was his method.&nbsp; As a rule, in
collaboration, one man does the work while the other looks
on.&nbsp; Is it likely that Dumas looked on?&nbsp; That was not
the manner of Dumas.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mirecourt and others,&rdquo; M.
About says, &ldquo;have wept crocodile tears for the
collaborators, the victims of his glory and his talent.&nbsp; But
it is difficult to lament over the survivors (1884).&nbsp; The
master neither took their money&mdash;for they are rich, nor
their fame&mdash;for they are celebrated, nor their
merit&mdash;for they had and still have plenty.&nbsp; And they
never bewailed their fate: the reverse!&nbsp; The proudest
congratulate themselves on having been at so good a school; and
M. Auguste Maquet, the chief of them, speaks with real reverence
and affection of his great friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; And M. About
writes &ldquo;as one who had taken the master red-handed, and in
the act of collaboration.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dumas has a curious note
on collaboration in his &ldquo;Souvenirs
Dramatiques.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of the two men at work together,
&ldquo;one is always the dupe, and <i>he</i> is the man of
talent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no biography of Dumas, but the small change of a
biography exists in abundance.&nbsp; There are the many volumes
of his &ldquo;M&eacute;moires,&rdquo; there are all the tomes he
wrote on his travels and adventures in Africa, Spain, Italy,
Russia; the book he wrote on his beasts; the romance of <i>Ange
Pitou</i>, partly autobiographical; and there are plenty of
little studies by people who knew him.&nbsp; As to his
&ldquo;M&eacute;moires,&rdquo; as to all he wrote about himself,
of course his imagination entered into the narrative.&nbsp; Like
Scott, when he had a good story he liked to dress it up with a
cocked hat and a sword.&nbsp; Did he perform all those
astonishing and innumerable feats of strength, skill, courage,
address, in revolutions, in voyages, in love, in war, in
cookery?&nbsp; The narrative need not be taken &ldquo;at the foot
of the letter&rdquo;; great as was his force and his courage, his
fancy was greater still.&nbsp; There is no room for a biography
of him here.&nbsp; His descent was noble on one side, with or
without the bend sinister, which he said he would never have
disclaimed, had it been his, but which he did not happen to
inherit.&nbsp; On the other side he <i>may</i> have descended
from kings; but, as in the case of &ldquo;The Fair Cuban,&rdquo;
he must have added, &ldquo;African, unfortunately.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Did his father perform these mythical feats of strength? did he
lift up a horse between his legs while clutching a rafter with
his hands? did he throw his regiment before him over a wall, as
Guy Heavistone threw the mare which refused the leap
(&ldquo;M&eacute;moires,&rdquo; i. 122)?&nbsp; No doubt Dumas
believed what he heard about this ancestor&mdash;in whom,
perhaps, one may see a hint of the giant Porthos.&nbsp; In the
Revolution and in the wars his father won the name of Monsieur de
l&rsquo;Humanit&eacute;, because he made a bonfire of a
guillotine; and of Horatius Cocles, because he held a pass as
bravely as the Roman &ldquo;in the brave days of old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a father to be proud of; and pluck, tenderness,
generosity, strength, remained the favourite virtues of
Dumas.&nbsp; These he preached and practised.&nbsp; They say he
was generous before he was just; it is to be feared this was
true, but he gave even more freely than he received.&nbsp; A
regiment of seedy people sponged on him always; he could not
listen to a tale of misery but he gave what he had, and sometimes
left himself short of a dinner.&nbsp; He could not even turn a
dog out of doors.&nbsp; At his Abbotsford, &ldquo;Monte
Cristo,&rdquo; the gates were open to everybody but
bailiffs.&nbsp; His dog asked other dogs to come and stay: twelve
came, making thirteen in all.&nbsp; The old butler wanted to turn
them adrift, and Dumas consented, and repented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Michel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there are some expenses
which a man&rsquo;s social position and the character which he
has had the ill-luck to receive from heaven force upon him.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t believe these dogs ruin me.&nbsp; Let them
bide!&nbsp; But, in the interests of their own good luck, see
they are not thirteen, an unfortunate number!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur, I&rsquo;ll drive one of them away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Michel; let a fourteenth come.&nbsp; These dogs
cost me some three pounds a month,&rdquo; said Dumas.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A dinner to five or six friends would cost thrice as much,
and, when they went home, they would say my wine was good, but
certainly that my books were bad.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this fashion
Dumas fared royally &ldquo;to the dogs,&rdquo; and his Abbotsford
ruined him as certainly as that other unhappy palace ruined Sir
Walter.&nbsp; He, too, had his miscellaneous kennel; he, too,
gave while he had anything to give, and, when he had nothing
else, gave the work of his pen.&nbsp; Dumas tells how his big
dog, Mouton once flew at him and bit one of his hands, while the
other held the throat of the brute.&nbsp; &ldquo;Luckily my hand,
though small, is powerful; what it once holds it holds
long&mdash;money excepted.&rdquo;&nbsp; He could not &ldquo;haud
a guid grip o&rsquo; the gear.&rdquo;&nbsp; Neither Scott nor
Dumas could shut his ears to a prayer or his pockets to a beggar,
or his doors on whoever knocked at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might at least have asked him to dinner,&rdquo; Scott
was heard murmuring, when some insufferable bore at last left
Abbotsford, after wasting his time and nearly wearing out his
patience.&nbsp; Neither man <i>preached</i> socialism; both
practised it on the Aristotelian principle: the goods of friends
are common, and men are our friends.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The death of Dumas&rsquo; father, while the son was a child,
left Madame Dumas in great poverty at Villers Cotterets.&nbsp;
Dumas&rsquo; education was sadly to seek.&nbsp; Like most
children destined to be bookish, he taught himself to read very
young: in Buffon, the Bible, and books of mythology.&nbsp; He
knew all about Jupiter&mdash;like David Copperfield&rsquo;s Tom
Jones, &ldquo;a child&rsquo;s Jupiter, an innocent
creature&rdquo;&mdash;all about every god, goddess, fawn, dryad,
nymph&mdash;and he never forgot this useful information.&nbsp;
Dear Lempri&egrave;re, thou art superseded; but how much more
delightful thou art than the fastidious Smith or the learned
Preller!&nbsp; Dumas had one volume of the &ldquo;Arabian
Nights,&rdquo; with Aladdin&rsquo;s lamp therein, the sacred lamp
which he was to keep burning with a flame so brilliant and so
steady.&nbsp; It is pleasant to know that, in his boyhood, this
great romancer loved Virgil.&nbsp; &ldquo;Little as is my Latin,
I have ever adored Virgil: his tenderness for exiles, his
melancholy vision of death, his foreboding of an unknown God,
have always moved me; the melody of his verses charmed me most,
and they lull me still between asleep and awake.&rdquo;&nbsp;
School days did not last long: Madame Dumas got a little
post&mdash;a licence to sell tobacco&mdash;and at fifteen Dumas
entered a notary&rsquo;s office, like his great Scotch
forerunner.&nbsp; He was ignorant of his vocation for the
stage&mdash;Racine and Corneille fatigued him
prodigiously&mdash;till he saw <i>Hamlet</i>: <i>Hamlet</i>
diluted by Ducis.&nbsp; He had never heard of Shakespeare, but
here was something he could appreciate.&nbsp; Here was &ldquo;a
profound impression, full of inexplicable emotion, vague desires,
fleeting lights, that, so far, lit up only a chaos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oddly enough, his earliest literary essay was the translation
of B&uuml;rger&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lenore.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, again,
he encounters Scott; but Scott translated the ballad, and Dumas
failed.&nbsp; <i>Les mortes vont vite</i>! the same refrain woke
poetry in both the Frenchman and the Scotchman.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! the Dead can ride with speed:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dost fear to ride with me?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Dumas&rsquo; literary career began with a defeat, but it
was always a beginning.&nbsp; He had just failed with
&ldquo;Lenore,&rdquo; when Leuven asked him to collaborate in a
play.&nbsp; He was utterly ignorant, he says; he had not
succeeded in gallant efforts to read through &ldquo;Gil
Blas&rdquo; and &ldquo;Don Quixote.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To my
shame,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;the man has not been more
fortunate with those masterpieces than the boy.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
had not yet heard of Scott, Cooper, Goethe; he had heard of
Shakespeare only as a barbarian.&nbsp; Other plays the boy
wrote&mdash;failures, of course&mdash;and then Dumas poached his
way to Paris, shooting partridges on the road, and paying the
hotel expenses by his success in the chase.&nbsp; He was
introduced to the great Talma: what a moment for Talma, had he
known it!&nbsp; He saw the theatres.&nbsp; He went home, but
returned to Paris, drew a small prize in a lottery, and sat next
a gentleman at the play, a gentleman who read the rarest of
Elzevirs, &ldquo;Le Pastissier Fran&ccedil;ais,&rdquo; and gave
him a little lecture on Elzevirs in general.&nbsp; Soon this
gentleman began to hiss the piece, and was turned out.&nbsp; He
was Charles Nodier, and one of the anonymous authors of the play
he was hissing!&nbsp; I own that this amusing chapter lacks
verisimilitude.&nbsp; It reads as if Dumas had chanced to
&ldquo;get up&rdquo; the subject of Elzevirs, and had fashioned
his new knowledge into a little story.&nbsp; He could make a
story out of anything&mdash;he &ldquo;turned all to favour and to
prettiness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Could I translate the whole passage, and
print it here, it would be longer than this article; but, ah, how
much more entertaining!&nbsp; For whatever Dumas did he did with
such life, spirit, wit, he told it with such vivacity, that his
whole career is one long romance of the highest quality.&nbsp;
Lassagne told him he must read&mdash;must read Goethe, Scott,
Cooper, Froissart, Joinville, Brant&ocirc;me.&nbsp; He read them
to some purpose.&nbsp; He entered the service of the Duc
d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans as a clerk, for he wrote a clear hand,
and, happily, wrote at astonishing speed.&nbsp; He is said to
have written a short play in a cottage where he went to rest for
an hour or two after shooting all the morning.&nbsp; The practice
in a notary&rsquo;s office stood him, as it stood Scott, in good
stead.&nbsp; When a dog bit his hand he managed to write a volume
without using his thumb.&nbsp; I have tried it, but
forbear&mdash;in mercy to the printers.&nbsp; He performed wild
feats of rapid caligraphy when a clerk under the Duc
d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans, and he wrote his plays in one
&ldquo;hand,&rdquo; his novels in another.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;hand&rdquo; used in his dramas he acquired when, in days
of poverty, he used to write in bed.&nbsp; To this habit he also
attributed the <i>brutalit&eacute;</i> of his earlier pieces, but
there seems to be no good reason why a man should write like a
brute because it is in bed that he writes.</p>
<p>In those days of small things he fought his first duel, and
made a study of Fear and Courage.&nbsp; His earliest impulse was
to rush at danger; if he had to wait, he felt his courage oozing
out at the tips of his fingers, like Bob Acres, but in the moment
of peril he was himself again.&nbsp; In dreams he was a coward,
because, as he argues, the natural man <i>is</i> a poltroon, and
conscience, honour, all the spiritual and commanding part of our
nature, goes to sleep in dreams.&nbsp; The animal terror asserts
itself unchecked.&nbsp; It is a theory not without
exceptions.&nbsp; In dreams one has plenty of conscience (at
least that is my experience), though it usually takes the form of
remorse.&nbsp; And in dreams one often affronts dangers which, in
waking hours, one might probably avoid if one could.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Dumas&rsquo; first play, an unimportant vaudeville, was acted
in 1825.&nbsp; His first novels were also published then; he took
part of the risk, and only four copies were sold.&nbsp; He
afterward used the ideas in more mature works, as Mr. Sheridan Le
Fanu employed three or four times (with perfect candour and
fairness) the most curious incident in &ldquo;Uncle
Silas.&rdquo;&nbsp; Like Mr. Arthur Pendennis, Dumas at this time
wrote poetry &ldquo;up to&rdquo; pictures and
illustrations.&nbsp; It is easy, but seldom lucrative work.&nbsp;
He translated a play of Schiller&rsquo;s into French verse,
chiefly to gain command of that vehicle, for his heart was fixed
on dramatic success.&nbsp; Then came the visit of Kean and other
English actors to Paris.&nbsp; He saw the true <i>Hamlet</i>,
and, for the first time on any stage, &ldquo;the play of real
passions.&rdquo;&nbsp; Emulation woke in him: a casual work of
art led him to the story of Christina of Sweden, he wrote his
play <i>Christine</i> (afterward reconstructed); he read it to
Baron Taylor, who applauded; the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise
accepted it, but a series of intrigues disappointed him, after
all.&nbsp; His energy at this moment was extraordinary, for he
was very poor, his mother had a stroke of paralysis, his bureau
was always bullying and interfering with him.&nbsp; But nothing
could snub this &ldquo;force of nature,&rdquo; and he immediately
produced his <i>Henri Trois</i>, the first romantic drama of
France.&nbsp; This had an instant and noisy success, and the
first night of the play he spent at the theatre, and at the
bedside of his unconscious mother.&nbsp; The poor lady could not
even understand whence the flowers came that he laid on her
couch, the flowers thrown to the young man&mdash;yesterday
unknown, and to-day the most famous of contemporary names.&nbsp;
All this tale of triumph, checkered by enmities and diversified
by duels, Dumas tells with the vigour and wit of his
novels.&nbsp; He is his own hero, and loses nothing in the
process; but the other characters&mdash;Taylor, Nodier, the Duc
d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans, the spiteful press-men, the crabbed old
officials&mdash;all live like the best of the persons in his
tales.&nbsp; They call Dumas vain: he had reason to be vain, and
no candid or generous reader will be shocked by his pleasant,
frank, and artless enjoyment of himself and of his
adventures.&nbsp; Oddly enough, they are small-minded and
small-hearted people who are most shocked by what they call
&ldquo;vanity&rdquo; in the great.&nbsp; Dumas&rsquo; delight in
himself and his doings is only the flower of his vigorous
existence, and in his &ldquo;M&eacute;moires,&rdquo; at least, it
is as happy and encouraging as his laugh, or the laugh of
Porthos; it is a kind of radiance, in which others, too, may bask
and enjoy themselves.&nbsp; And yet it is resented by tiny
scribblers, frozen in their own chill self-conceit.</p>
<p>There is nothing incredible (if modern researches are
accurate) in the stories he tells of his own success in
Hypnotism, as it is called now, Mesmerism or Magnetism as it was
called then.&nbsp; Who was likely to possess these powers, if not
this good-humoured natural force?&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe that, by
aid of magnetism, a bad man might do much mischief.&nbsp; I doubt
whether, by help of magnetism, a good man can do the slightest
good,&rdquo; he says, probably with perfect justice.&nbsp; His
dramatic success fired Victor Hugo, and very pleasant it is to
read Dumas&rsquo; warm-hearted praise of that great poet.&nbsp;
Dumas had no jealousy&mdash;no more than Scott.&nbsp; As he
believed in no success without talent, so he disbelieved in
genius which wins no success.&nbsp; &ldquo;Je ne crois pas au
talent ignor&eacute;, au g&eacute;nie inconnu, moi.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Genius he saluted wherever he met it, but was incredulous about
invisible and inaudible genius; and I own to sharing his
scepticism.&nbsp; People who complain of Dumas&rsquo; vanity may
be requested to observe that he seems just as &ldquo;vain&rdquo;
of Hugo&rsquo;s successes, or of Scribe&rsquo;s, as of his own,
and just as much delighted by them.</p>
<p>He was now struck, as he walked on the boulevard one day, by
the first idea of <i>Antony</i>&mdash;an idea which, to be fair,
seems rather absurd than tragic, to some tastes.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
lover, caught with a married woman, kills her to save her
character, and dies on the scaffold.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here is indeed
a part to tear a cat in!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The performances of M. Dumas during the Revolution of 1830,
are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of Alexandre
the Great?&nbsp; But they were not literary excellences which he
then displayed, and we may leave this king-maker to hover,
&ldquo;like an eagle, above the storms of anarchy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even to sketch his later biography is beyond our
province.&nbsp; In 1830 he had forty years to run, and he filled
the cup of the Hours to the brim with activity and
adventure.&nbsp; His career was one of unparalleled production,
punctuated by revolutions, voyages, exiles, and other intervals
of repose.&nbsp; The tales he tells of his prowess in 1830, and
with Garibaldi, seem credible to me, and are borne out, so far,
by the narrative of M. Maxime Ducamp, who met him at Naples, in
the Garibaldian camp.&nbsp; Like Mr. Jingle, in
&ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; he &ldquo;banged the field-piece, twanged
the lyre,&rdquo; and was potting at the foes of the republic with
a double-barrelled gun, when he was not composing plays,
romances, memoirs, criticisms.&nbsp; He has told the tale of his
adventures with the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise, where the
actors laughed at his <i>Antony</i>, and where Madame Mars and he
quarrelled and made it up again.&nbsp; His plays often won an
extravagant success; his novels&mdash;his great novels, that
is&mdash;made all Europe his friend.&nbsp; He gained large sums
of money, which flowed out of his fingers, though it is said by
some that his Abbotsford, Monte Cristo, was no more a palace than
the villa which a retired tradesman builds to shelter his old
age.&nbsp; But the money disappeared as fast as if Monte Cristo
had really been palatial, and worthy of the fantasy of a
Nero.&nbsp; He got into debt, fled to Belgium, returned, founded
the <i>Mousquetaire</i>, a literary paper of the strangest and
most shiftless kind.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Alexandre Dumas &agrave; la
Maison d&rsquo;Or,&rdquo; M. Philibert Audebrand tells the tale
of this Micawber of newspapers.&nbsp; Everything went into it,
good or bad, and the name of Dumas was expected to make all
current coin.&nbsp; For Dumas, unluckily, was as prodigal of his
name as of his gold, and no reputation could bear the drafts he
made on his celebrity.&nbsp; His son says, in the preface to
<i>Le Fils Naturel</i>: &ldquo;Tragedy, dramas, history, romance,
comedy, travel, you cast all of them in the furnace and the mould
of your brain, and you peopled the world of fiction with new
creations.&nbsp; The newspaper, the book, the theatre, burst
asunder, too narrow for your puissant shoulders; you fed France,
Europe, America with your works; you made the wealth of
publishers, translators, plagiarists; printers and copyists
toiled after you in vain.&nbsp; In the fever of production you
did not always try and prove the metal which you employed, and
sometimes you tossed into the furnace whatever came to your
hand.&nbsp; The fire made the selection: what was your own is
bronze, what was not yours vanished in smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The simile is noble and worthy of the Cyclopean craftsman,
Dumas.&nbsp; His great works endured; the plays which renewed the
youth of the French stage, the novels which Thackeray loved to
praise, these remain, and we trust they may always remain, to the
delight of mankind and for the sorrow of prigs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>So much has been written of Dumas&rsquo; novels that criticism
can hardly hope to say more that is both new and true about
them.&nbsp; It is acknowledged that, in such a character as Henri
III., Dumas made history live, as magically as Scott revived the
past in his Louis XI., or Balfour of Burley.&nbsp; It is admitted
that Dumas&rsquo; good tales are told with a vigour and life
which rejoice the heart; that his narrative is never dull, never
stands still, but moves with a freedom of adventure which perhaps
has no parallel.&nbsp; He may fall short of the humour, the
kindly wisdom, the genial greatness of Sir Walter at his best,
and he has not that supernatural touch, that tragic grandeur,
which Scott inherits from Homer and from Shakespeare.&nbsp; In
another Homeric quality, &chi;&alpha;&rho;y&eta;, as Homer
himself calls it, in the &ldquo;delight of battle&rdquo; and the
spirit of the fray, Scott and Dumas are alike masters.&nbsp;
Their fights and the fights in the Icelandic sagas are the best
that have ever been drawn by mortal man.&nbsp; When swords are
aloft, in siege or on the greensward, or in the midnight chamber
where an ambush is laid, Scott and Dumas are indeed
themselves.&nbsp; The steel rings, the bucklers clash, the parry
and lunge pass and answer too swift for the sight.&nbsp; If Dumas
has not, as he certainly has not, the noble philosophy and kindly
knowledge of the heart which are Scott&rsquo;s, he is far more
swift, more witty, more diverting.&nbsp; He is not prolix, his
style is not involved, his dialogue is as rapid and keen as an
assault at arms.&nbsp; His favourite virtues and graces, we
repeat it, are loyalty, friendship, gaiety, generosity, courage,
beauty, and strength.&nbsp; He is himself the friend of the big,
stupid, excellent Porthos; of Athos, the noble and melancholy
swordsman of sorrow; of D&rsquo;Artagnan, the indomitable, the
trusty, the inexhaustible in resource; but his heart is never on
the side of the shifty Aramis, with all his beauty, dexterity,
bravery, and brilliance.&nbsp; The brave Bussy, and the
chivalrous, the doomed La Mole, are more dear to him; and if he
embellishes their characters, giving them charms and virtues that
never were theirs, history loses nothing, and romance and we are
the gainers.&nbsp; In all he does, at his best, as in the
&ldquo;Chevalier d&rsquo;Harmenthal,&rdquo; he has movement,
kindness, courage, and gaiety.&nbsp; His philosophy of life is
that old philosophy of the sagas and of Homer.&nbsp; Let us enjoy
the movement of the fray, the faces of fair women, the taste of
good wine; let us welcome life like a mistress, let us welcome
death like a friend, and with a jest&mdash;if death comes with
honour.</p>
<p>Dumas is no pessimist.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven has made but one
drama for man&mdash;the world,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;and
during these three thousand years mankind has been hissing
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is certain that, if a moral censorship could
have prevented it, this great drama of mortal passions would
never have been licensed, at all, never performed.&nbsp; But
Dumas, for one, will not hiss it, but applauds with all his
might&mdash;a charmed spectator, a fortunate actor in the eternal
piece, where all the men and women are only players.&nbsp; You
hear his manly laughter, you hear his mighty hands approving, you
see the tears he sheds when he had &ldquo;slain
Porthos&rdquo;&mdash;great tears like those of Pantagruel.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>His may not be the best, nor the ultimate philosophy, but it
<i>is</i> a philosophy, and one of which we may some day feel the
want.&nbsp; I read the stilted criticisms, the pedantic carpings
of some modern men who cannot write their own language, and I
gather that Dumas is out of date.&nbsp; There is a new philosophy
of doubts and delicacies, of dallyings and refinements, of
half-hearted lookers-on, desiring and fearing some new order of
the world.&nbsp; Dumas does not dally nor doubt: he takes his
side, he rushes into the smoke, he strikes his foe; but there is
never an unkind word on his lip, nor a grudging thought in his
heart.</p>
<p>It may be said that Dumas is not a master of words and
phrases, that he is not a <i>raffin&eacute;</i> of expression,
nor a jeweller of style.&nbsp; When I read the maunderings, the
stilted and staggering sentences, the hesitating phrases, the
far-sought and dear-bought and worthless word-juggles; the sham
scientific verbiage, the native pedantries of many modern
so-called &ldquo;stylists,&rdquo; I rejoice that Dumas was not
one of these.&nbsp; He told a plain tale, in the language suited
to a plain tale, with abundance of wit and gaiety, as in the
reflections of his Chicot, as in all his dialogues.&nbsp; But he
did not gnaw the end of his pen in search of some word that
nobody had ever used in this or that connection before.&nbsp; The
right word came to him, the simple straightforward phrase.&nbsp;
Epithet-hunting may be a pretty sport, and the bag of the
epithet-hunter may contain some agreeable epigrams and rare
specimens of style; but a plain tale of adventure, of love and
war, needs none of this industry, and is even spoiled by
inopportune diligence.&nbsp; Speed, directness, lucidity are the
characteristics of Dumas&rsquo; style, and they are exactly the
characteristics which his novels required.&nbsp; Scott often
failed, his most loyal admirers may admit, in these essentials;
but it is rarely that Dumas fails, when he is himself and at his
best.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>In spite of his heedless education, Dumas had true critical
qualities, and most admired the best things.&nbsp; We have
already seen how he writes about Shakespeare, Virgil, Goethe,
Scott.&nbsp; But it may be less familiarly known that this burly
man-of-all-work, ignorant as he was of Greek, had a true and keen
appreciation of Homer.&nbsp; Dumas declares that he only thrice
criticised his contemporaries in an unfavourable sense, and as
one wishful to find fault.&nbsp; The victims were Casimir
Delavigne, Scribe, and Ponsard.&nbsp; On each occasion Dumas
declares that, after reflecting, he saw that he was moved by a
little personal pique, not by a disinterested love of art.&nbsp;
He makes his confession with a rare nobility of candour; and yet
his review of Ponsard is worthy of him.&nbsp; M. Ponsard, who,
like Dumas, was no scholar, wrote a play styled <i>Ulysse</i>,
and borrowed from the Odyssey.&nbsp; Dumas follows Ponsard,
Odyssey in hand, and while he proves that the dramatist failed to
understand Homer, proves that he himself was, in essentials, a
capable Homeric critic.&nbsp; Dumas understands that far-off
heroic age.&nbsp; He lives in its life and sympathises with its
temper.&nbsp; Homer and he are congenial; across the great gulf
of time they exchange smiles and a salute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! ancient Homer, dear and good and noble, I am minded
now and again to leave all and translate thee&mdash;I, who have
never a word of Greek&mdash;so empty and so dismal are the
versions men make of thee, in verse or in prose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How Dumas came to divine Homer, as it were, through a language
he knew not, who shall say?&nbsp; He <i>did</i> divine him by a
natural sympathy of excellence, and his chapters on the
&ldquo;Ulysse&rdquo; of Ponsard are worth a wilderness of notes
by learned and most un-Homeric men.&nbsp; For, indeed, who can be
less like the heroic minstrel than the academic philologist?</p>
<p>This universality deserves note.&nbsp; The Homeric student who
takes up a volume of Dumas at random finds that he is not only
Homeric naturally, but that he really knows his Homer.&nbsp; What
did he nor know?&nbsp; His rapidity in reading must have been as
remarkable as his pace with the pen.&nbsp; As M. Blaze de Bury
says: &ldquo;Instinct, experience, memory were all his; he sees
at a glance, he compares in a flash, he understands without
conscious effort, he forgets nothing that he has
read.&rdquo;&nbsp; The past and present are photographed
imperishably on his brain, he knows the manners of all ages and
all countries, the names of all the arms that men have used, all
the garments they have worn, all the dishes they have tasted, all
the terms of all professions, from swordsmanship to
coach-building.&nbsp; Other authors have to wait, and hunt for
facts; nothing stops Dumas: he knows and remembers
everything.&nbsp; Hence his rapidity, his facility, his positive
delight in labour: hence it came that he might be heard, like
Dickens, laughing while he worked.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>This is rather a eulogy than a criticism of Dumas.&nbsp; His
faults are on the surface, visible to all men.&nbsp; He was not
only rapid, he was hasty, he was inconsistent; his need of money
as well as his love of work made him put his hand to dozens of
perishable things.&nbsp; A beginner, entering the forest of
Dumas&rsquo; books, may fail to see the trees for the wood.&nbsp;
He may be counselled to select first the cycle of
d&rsquo;Artagnan&mdash;the &ldquo;Musketeers,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Twenty Years After,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Vicomte de
Bragelonne.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s delightful essay
on the last may have sent many readers to it; I confess to
preferring the youth of the &ldquo;Musketeers&rdquo; to their old
age.&nbsp; Then there is the cycle of the Valois, whereof the
&ldquo;Dame de Monsereau&rdquo; is the best&mdash;perhaps the
best thing Dumas ever wrote.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Tulipe Noire&rdquo;
is a novel girls may read, as Thackeray said, with
confidence.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Chevalier d&rsquo;Harmenthal&rdquo;
is nearly (not quite) as good as &ldquo;Quentin
Durward.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Monte Cristo&rdquo; has the best
beginning&mdash;and loses itself in the sands.&nbsp; The novels
on the Revolution are not among the most alluring: the famed
device &ldquo;L. P. D.&rdquo; (<i>lilia pedibus destrue</i>) has
the bad luck to suggest &ldquo;London Parcels
Delivery.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is an accident, but the Revolution is
in itself too terrible and pitiful, and too near us (on both
sides!) for fiction.</p>
<p>On Dumas&rsquo; faults it has been no pleasure to dwell.&nbsp;
In a recent work I find the Jesuit Le Moyne quoted, saying about
Charles V.: &ldquo;What need that future ages should be made
acquainted so religious an Emperor was not always
chaste!&rdquo;&nbsp; The same reticence allures one in regard to
so delightful an author as Dumas.&nbsp; He who had enriched so
many died poor; he who had told of conquering France, died during
the Terrible Year.&nbsp; But he could forgive, could appreciate,
the valour of an enemy.&nbsp; Of the Scotch at Waterloo he
writes: &ldquo;It was not enough to kill them: we had to push
them down.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dead, they still stood &ldquo;shoulder to
shoulder.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the same generous temper an English
cavalry officer wrote home, after Waterloo, that he would gladly
have given the rest of his life to have served, on that day, in
our infantry or in the French cavalry.&nbsp; These are the
spirits that warm the heart, that make us all friends; and to the
great, the brave, the generous Dumas we cry, across the years and
across the tomb, our <i>Ave atque vale</i>!</p>
<h2>MR. STEVENSON&rsquo;S WORKS</h2>
<p>Perhaps the first quality in Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s works, now
so many and so various, which strikes a reader, is the buoyancy,
the survival of the child in him.&nbsp; He has told the world
often, in prose and verse, how vivid are his memories of his own
infancy.&nbsp; This retention of childish recollections he
shares, no doubt, with other people of genius: for example, with
George Sand, whose legend of her own infancy is much more
entertaining, and perhaps will endure longer, than her
novels.&nbsp; Her youth, like Scott&rsquo;s and like Mr.
Stevenson&rsquo;s, was passed all in fantasy: in playing at being
some one else, in the invention of imaginary characters, who were
living to her, in the fabrication of endless unwritten
romances.&nbsp; Many persons, who do not astonish the world by
their genius, have lived thus in their earliest youth.&nbsp; But,
at a given moment, the fancy dies out of them: this often befalls
imaginative boys in their first year at school.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many
are called, few chosen&rdquo;; but it may be said with probable
truth, that there has never been a man of genius in letters,
whose boyhood was not thus fantastic, &ldquo;an isle of
dreams.&rdquo;&nbsp; We know how Scott and De Quincey inhabited
airy castles; and Gillies tells us, though Lockhart does not,
that Scott, in manhood, was occasionally so lost in thought, that
he knew not where he was nor what he was doing.</p>
<p>The peculiarity of Mr. Stevenson is not only to have been a
fantastic child, and to retain, in maturity, that fantasy ripened
into imagination: he has also kept up the habit of dramatising
everything, of playing, half consciously, many parts, of making
the world &ldquo;an unsubstantial fairy place.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
turn of mind it is that causes his work occasionally to seem
somewhat freakish.&nbsp; Thus, in the fogs and horrors of London,
he plays at being an Arabian tale-teller, and his &ldquo;New
Arabian Nights&rdquo; are a new kind of
romanticism&mdash;Oriental, freakish, like the work of a
changeling.&nbsp; Indeed, this curious genius, springing from a
family of Scottish engineers, resembles nothing so much as one of
the fairy children, whom the ladies of Queen Proserpina&rsquo;s
court used to leave in the cradles of Border keeps or of
peasants&rsquo; cottages.&nbsp; Of the Scot he has little but the
power of touching us with a sense of the supernatural, and a
decided habit of moralising; for no Scot of genius has been more
austere with Robert Burns.&nbsp; On the other hand, one element
of Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s ethical disquisitions is derived from
his dramatic habit.&nbsp; His optimism, his gay courage, his
habit of accepting the world as very well worth living in and
looking at, persuaded one of his critics that he was a
hard-hearted young athlete of iron frame.&nbsp; Now, of the
athlete he has nothing but his love of the open air: it is the
eternal child that drives him to seek adventures and to sojourn
among beach-combers and savages.&nbsp; Thus, an admiring but far
from optimistic critic may doubt whether Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s
content with the world is not &ldquo;only his fun,&rdquo; as Lamb
said of Coleridge&rsquo;s preaching; whether he is but playing at
being the happy warrior in life; whether he is not acting that
part, himself to himself.&nbsp; At least, it is a part
fortunately conceived and admirably sustained: a difficult part
too, whereas that of the pessimist is as easy as whining.</p>
<p>Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s work has been very much written about,
as it has engaged and delighted readers of every age, station,
and character.&nbsp; Boys, of course, have been specially
addressed in the books of adventure, children in &ldquo;A
Child&rsquo;s Garden of Verse,&rdquo; young men and maidens in
&ldquo;Virginibus Puerisque,&rdquo;&mdash;all ages in all the
curiously varied series of volumes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kidnapped&rdquo;
was one of the last books which the late Lord Iddesleigh read;
and I trust there is no harm in mentioning the pleasure which Mr.
Matthew Arnold took in the same story.&nbsp; Critics of every
sort have been kind to Mr. Stevenson, in spite of the fact that
the few who first became acquainted with his genius praised it
with all the warmth of which they were masters.&nbsp; Thus he has
become a kind of classic in his own day, for an undisputed
reputation makes a classic while it lasts.&nbsp; But was ever so
much fame won by writings which might be called scrappy and
desultory by the <i>advocatus diaboli</i>?&nbsp; It is a most
miscellaneous literary baggage that Mr. Stevenson carries.&nbsp;
First, a few magazine articles; then two little books of
sentimental journeyings, which convince the reader that Mr.
Stevenson is as good company to himself as his books are to
others.&nbsp; Then came a volume or two of essays, literary and
social, on books and life.&nbsp; By this time there could be no
doubt that Mr. Stevenson had a style of his own, modelled to some
extent on the essayists of the last century, but with touches of
Thackeray; with original breaks and turns, with a delicate
freakishness, in short, and a determined love of saying things as
the newspapers do not say them.&nbsp; All this work undoubtedly
smelt a trifle of the lamp, and was therefore dear to some, and
an offence to others.&nbsp; For my part, I had delighted in the
essays, from the first that appeared in <i>Macmillan&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>, shortly after the Franco-German war.&nbsp; In this
little study, &ldquo;Ordered South,&rdquo; Mr. Stevenson was
employing himself in extracting all the melancholy pleasure which
the Riviera can give to a wearied body and a mind resisting the
clouds of early malady,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Alas, the worn and broken board,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How can it bear the painter&rsquo;s dye!<br />
The harp of strained and tuneless chord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How to the minstrel&rsquo;s skill reply!<br />
To aching eyes each landscape lowers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To feverish pulse each gale blows chill,<br />
And Araby&rsquo;s or Eden&rsquo;s bowers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were barren as this moorland hill,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>wrote Scott, in an hour of malady and depression.&nbsp; But
this was not the spirit of &ldquo;Ordered South&rdquo;: the
younger soul rose against the tyranny of the body; and that
familiar glamour which, in illness, robs Tintoretto of his glow,
did not spoil the midland sea to Mr. Stevenson.&nbsp; His gallant
and cheery stoicism were already with him; and so perfect, if a
trifle overstudied, was his style, that one already foresaw a new
and charming essayist.</p>
<p>But none of those early works, nor the delightful book on
Edinburgh, prophesied of the story teller.&nbsp; Mr.
Stevenson&rsquo;s first published tales, the &ldquo;New Arabian
Nights,&rdquo; originally appeared in a quaintly edited weekly
paper, which nobody read, or nobody but the writers in its
columns.&nbsp; They welcomed the strange romances with
rejoicings: but perhaps there was only one of them who foresaw
that Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s <i>forte</i> was to be fiction, not
essay writing; that he was to appeal with success to the large
public, and not to the tiny circle who surround the
essayist.&nbsp; It did not seem likely that our incalculable
public would make themselves at home in those fantastic purlieus
which Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s fancy discovered near the
Strand.&nbsp; The impossible Young Man with the Cream Tarts, the
ghastly revels of the Suicide Club, the Oriental caprices of the
Hansom Cabs&mdash;who could foresee that the public would taste
them!&nbsp; It is true that Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s imagination
made the President of the Club, and the cowardly member, Mr.
Malthus, as real as they were terrible.&nbsp; His romance always
goes hand in hand with reality; and Mr. Malthus is as much an
actual man of skin and bone, as Silas Lapham is a man of flesh
and blood.&nbsp; The world saw this, and applauded the
&ldquo;Noctes of Prince Floristan,&rdquo; in a fairy London.</p>
<p>Yet, excellent and unique as these things were, Mr. Stevenson
had not yet &ldquo;found himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would be more
true to say that he had only discovered outlying skirts of his
dominions.&nbsp; Has he ever hit on the road to the capital yet?
and will he ever enter it laurelled, and in triumph?&nbsp; That
is precisely what one may doubt, not as without hope.&nbsp; He is
always making discoveries in his realm; it is less certain that
he will enter its chief city in state.&nbsp; His next work was
rather in the nature of annexation and invasion than a settling
of his own realms.&nbsp; &ldquo;Prince Otto&rdquo; is not, to my
mind, a ruler in his proper soil.&nbsp; The provinces of George
Sand and of Mr. George Meredith have been taken captive.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Prince Otto&rdquo; is fantastic indeed, but neither the
fantasy nor the style is quite Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s.&nbsp; There
are excellent passages, and the Scotch soldier of fortune is
welcome, and the ladies abound in subtlety and wit.&nbsp; But the
book, at least to myself, seems an extremely elaborate and
skilful <i>pastiche</i>.&nbsp; I cannot believe in the
persons.&nbsp; I vaguely smell a moral allegory (as in
&ldquo;Will of the Mill&rdquo;).&nbsp; I do not clearly
understand what it is all about.&nbsp; The scene is fairyland;
but it is not the fairyland of Perrault.&nbsp; The ladies are
beautiful and witty; but they are escaped from a novel of Mr.
Meredith&rsquo;s, and have no business here.&nbsp; The book is no
more Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s than &ldquo;The Tale of Two
Cities&rdquo; was Mr. Dickens&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It was probably by way of mere diversion and child&rsquo;s
play that Mr. Stevenson began &ldquo;Treasure
Island.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is an amateur of boyish pleasures of
masterpieces at a penny plain and twopence coloured.&nbsp;
Probably he had looked at the stories of adventure in penny
papers which only boys read, and he determined sportively to
compete with their unknown authors.&nbsp; &ldquo;Treasure
Island&rdquo; came out in such a periodical, with the emphatic
woodcuts which adorn them.&nbsp; It is said that the puerile
public was not greatly stirred.&nbsp; A story is a story, and
they rather preferred the regular purveyors.&nbsp; The very faint
archaism of the style may have alienated them.&nbsp; But, when
&ldquo;Treasure Island&rdquo; appeared as a real book, then every
one who had a smack of youth left was a boy again for some happy
hours.&nbsp; Mr. Stevenson had entered into another province of
his realm: the king had come to his own again.</p>
<p>They say the seamanship is inaccurate; I care no more than I
do for the year 30.&nbsp; They say too many people are
killed.&nbsp; They all died in fair fight, except a victim of
John Silver&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The conclusion is a little too like
part of Poe&rsquo;s most celebrated tale, but nobody has bellowed
&ldquo;Plagiarist!&rdquo;&nbsp; Some people may not look over a
fence: Mr. Stevenson, if he liked, might steal a horse,&mdash;the
animal in this case is only a skeleton.&nbsp; A very sober
student might add that the hero is impossibly clever; but, then,
the hero is a boy, and this is a boy&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; For the
rest, the characters live.&nbsp; Only genius could have invented
John Silver, that terribly smooth-spoken mariner.&nbsp; Nothing
but genius could have drawn that simple yokel on the island, with
his craving for cheese as a Christian dainty.&nbsp; The
blustering Billy Bones is a little masterpiece: the blind Pew,
with his tapping stick (there are three such blind tappers in Mr.
Stevenson&rsquo;s books), strikes terror into the boldest.&nbsp;
Then, the treasure is thoroughly satisfactory in kind, and there
is plenty of it.&nbsp; The landscape, as in the feverish,
fog-smothered flat, is gallantly painted.&nbsp; And there are no
interfering petticoats in the story.</p>
<p>As for the &ldquo;Black Arrow,&rdquo; I confess to sharing the
disabilities of the &ldquo;Critic on the Hearth,&rdquo; to whom
it is dedicated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kidnapped&rdquo; is less a story
than a fragment; but it is a noble fragment.&nbsp; Setting aside
the wicked old uncle, who in his later behaviour is of the house
of Ralph Nickleby, &ldquo;Kidnapped&rdquo; is all
excellent&mdash;perhaps Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s masterpiece.&nbsp;
Perhaps, too, only a Scotchman knows how good it is, and only a
Lowland Scot knows how admirable a character is the dour, brave,
conceited David Balfour.&nbsp; It is like being in Scotland again
to come on &ldquo;the green drive-road running wide through the
heather,&rdquo; where David &ldquo;took his last look of Kirk
Essendean, the trees about the manse, and the big rowans in the
kirkyard, where his father and mother lay.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perfectly
Scotch, too, is the mouldering, empty house of the Miser, with
the stamped leather on the walls.&nbsp; And the Miser is as good
as a Scotch Trapbois, till he becomes homicidal, and then one
fails to recognise him unless he is a little mad, like that other
frantic uncle in &ldquo;The Merry Men.&rdquo;&nbsp; The scenes on
the ship, with the boy who is murdered, are better&mdash;I think
more real&mdash;than the scenes of piratical life in &ldquo;The
Master of Ballantrae.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fight in the Round House,
even if it were exaggerated, would be redeemed by the &ldquo;Song
of the Sword of Alan.&rdquo;&nbsp; As to Alan Breck himself, with
his valour and vanity, his good heart, his good conceit of
himself, his fantastic loyalty, he is absolutely worthy of the
hand that drew Callum Bey and the Dougal creature.&nbsp; It is
just possible that we see, in &ldquo;Kidnapped,&rdquo; more signs
of determined labour, more evidence of touches and retouches,
than in &ldquo;Rob Roy.&rdquo;&nbsp; In nothing else which it
attempts is it inferior; in mastery of landscape, as in the scene
of the lonely rock in a dry and thirsty land, it is
unsurpassed.&nbsp; If there are signs of laboured handling on
Alan, there are none in the sketches of Cluny and of Rob
Roy&rsquo;s son, the piper.&nbsp; What a generous artist is
Alan!&nbsp; &ldquo;Robin Oig,&rdquo; he said, when it was done,
&ldquo;ye are a great piper.&nbsp; I am not fit to blow in the
same kingdom with you.&nbsp; Body of me! ye have mair music in
your sporran than I have in my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kidnapped,&rdquo; we said, is a fragment.&nbsp; It ends
anywhere, or nowhere, as if the pen had dropped from a weary
hand.&nbsp; Thus, and for other reasons, one cannot pretend to
set what is not really a whole against such a rounded whole as
&ldquo;Rob Roy,&rdquo; or against &ldquo;The Legend of
Montrose.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, &ldquo;Kidnapped&rdquo; is a novel
without a woman in it: not here is Di Vernon, not here is Helen
McGregor.&nbsp; David Balfour is the pragmatic Lowlander; he does
not bear comparison, excellent as he is, with Baillie Nicol
Jarvie, the humorous Lowlander: he does not live in the memory
like the immortal Baillie.&nbsp; It is as a series of scenes and
sketches that &ldquo;Kidnapped&rdquo; is unmatched among Mr.
Stevenson&rsquo;s works.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;The Master of Ballantrae&rdquo; Mr. Stevenson makes
a gallant effort to enter what I have ventured to call the
capital of his kingdom.&nbsp; He does introduce a woman, and
confronts the problems of love as well as of fraternal
hatred.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Master&rdquo; is studied, is polished
<i>ad unguem</i>; it is a whole in itself, it is a remarkably
daring attempt to write the tragedy, as, in
&ldquo;Waverley,&rdquo; Scott wrote the romance, of Scotland
about the time of the Forty-Five.&nbsp; With such a predecessor
and rival, Mr. Stevenson wisely leaves the pomps and battles of
the Forty-Five, its chivalry and gallantry, alone.&nbsp; He shows
us the seamy side: the intrigues, domestic and political; the
needy Irish adventurer with the Prince, a person whom Scott had
not studied.&nbsp; The book, if completely successful, would be
Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bride of Lammermoor.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
be frank, I do not think it completely successful&mdash;a victory
all along the line.&nbsp; The obvious weak point is Secundra
Dass, that Indian of unknown nationality; for surely his name
marks him as no Hindoo.&nbsp; The Master could not have brought
him, shivering like Jos Sedley&rsquo;s black servant, to
Scotland.&nbsp; As in America, this alien would have found it
&ldquo;too dam cold.&rdquo;&nbsp; My power of belief (which
verges on credulity) is staggered by the ghastly attempt to
reanimate the buried Master.&nbsp; Here, at least to my taste,
the freakish changeling has got the better of Mr. Stevenson, and
has brought in an element out of keeping with the steady lurid
tragedy of fraternal hatred.&nbsp; For all the rest, it were a
hard judge that had anything but praise.&nbsp; The brilliant
blackguardism of the Master; his touch of sentiment as he leaves
Durisdeer for the last time, with a sad old song on his lips; his
fascination; his ruthlessness; his irony;&mdash;all are
perfect.&nbsp; It is not very easy to understand the Chevalier
Bourke, that Barry Lyndon, with no head and with a good heart,
that creature of a bewildered kindly conscience; but it is easy
to like him.&nbsp; How admirable is his undeflected belief in and
affection for the Master!&nbsp; How excellent and how Irish he
is, when he buffoons himself out of his perils with the
pirates!&nbsp; The scenes are brilliant and living, as when the
Master throws the guinea through the Hall window, or as in the
darkling duel in the garden.&nbsp; It needed an austere artistic
conscience to make Henry, the younger brother, so unlovable with
all his excellence, and to keep the lady so true, yet so much in
shadow.&nbsp; This is the best woman among Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s
few women; but even she is almost always reserved, veiled as it
were.</p>
<p>The old Lord, again, is a portrait as lifelike as Scott could
have drawn, and more delicately touched than Scott would have
cared to draw it: a French companion picture to the Baron
Bradwardine.&nbsp; The whole piece reads as if Mr. Stevenson had
engaged in a struggle with himself as he wrote.&nbsp; The sky is
never blue, the sun never shines: we weary for a &ldquo;westland
wind.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is something &ldquo;thrawn,&rdquo; as
the Scotch say, about the story; there is often a touch of this
sinister kind in the author&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; The language is
extraordinarily artful, as in the mad lord&rsquo;s words,
&ldquo;I have felt the hilt dirl on his breast-bone.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And yet, one is hardly thrilled as one expects to be, when, as
Mackellar says, &ldquo;the week-old corpse looked me for a moment
in the face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Probably none of Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s many books has made his
name so familiar as &ldquo;Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
read it first in manuscript, alone, at night; and, when the
Butler and Mr. Urmson came to the Doctor&rsquo;s door, I confess
that I threw it down, and went hastily to bed.&nbsp; It is the
most gruesome of all his writings, and so perfect that one can
complain only of the slightly too obvious moral; and, again, that
really Mr. Hyde was more of a gentleman than the unctuous Dr.
Jekyll, with his &ldquo;bedside manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So here, not to speak of some admirable short stories like
&ldquo;Thrawn Janet,&rdquo; is a brief catalogue&mdash;little
more&mdash;of Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s literary baggage.&nbsp; It is
all good, though variously good; yet the wise world asks for the
masterpiece.&nbsp; It is said that Mr. Stevenson has not ventured
on the delicate and dangerous ground of the novel, because he has
not written a modern love story.&nbsp; But who has?&nbsp; There
are love affairs in Dickens, but do we remember or care for
them?&nbsp; Is it the love affairs that we remember in
Scott?&nbsp; Thackeray may touch us with Clive&rsquo;s and Jack
Belsize&rsquo;s misfortunes, with Esmond&rsquo;s melancholy
passion, and amuse us with Pen in so many toils, and interest us
in the little heroine of the &ldquo;Shabby Genteel
Story.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it is not by virtue of those episodes
that Thackeray is so great.&nbsp; Love stories are best done by
women, as in &ldquo;Mr. Gilfil&rsquo;s Love Story&rdquo;; and,
perhaps, in an ordinary way, by writers like Trollope.&nbsp; One
may defy critics to name a great English author in fiction whose
chief and distinguishing merit is in his pictures of the passion
of Love.&nbsp; Still, they all give Love his due stroke in the
battle, and perhaps Mr. Stevenson will do so some day.&nbsp; But
I confess that, if he ever excels himself, I do not expect it to
be in a love story.</p>
<p>Possibly it may be in a play.&nbsp; If he again attempt the
drama, he has this in his favour, that he will not deal in
supernumeraries.&nbsp; In his tales his minor characters are as
carefully drawn as his chief personages.&nbsp; Consider, for
example, the minister, Henderland, the man who is so fond of
snuff, in &ldquo;Kidnapped,&rdquo; and, in the &ldquo;Master of
Ballantrae,&rdquo; Sir William Johnson, the English
Governor.&nbsp; They are the work of a mind as attentive to
details, as ready to subordinate or obliterate details which are
unessential.&nbsp; Thus Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s writings breathe
equally of work in the study and of inspiration from adventure in
the open air, and thus he wins every vote, and pleases every
class of reader.</p>
<h2>THOMAS HAYNES BAYLY</h2>
<p>I cannot sing the old songs, nor indeed any others, but I can
read them, in the neglected works of Thomas Haynes Bayly.&nbsp;
The name of Bayly may be unfamiliar, but every one almost has
heard his ditties chanted&mdash;every one much over forty, at all
events.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hang my Harp on a Willow
Tree,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be a Butterfly,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Oh, no! we never mention Her,&rdquo; are dimly dear to
every friend of Mr. Richard Swiveller.&nbsp; If to be sung
everywhere, to hear your verses uttered in harmony with all
pianos and quoted by the world at large, be fame, Bayly had
it.&nbsp; He was an unaffected poet.&nbsp; He wrote words to
airs, and he is almost absolutely forgotten.&nbsp; To read him is
to be carried back on the wings of music to the bowers of youth;
and to the bowers of youth I have been wafted, and to the old
booksellers.&nbsp; You do not find on every stall the poems of
Bayly; but a copy in two volumes has been discovered, edited by
Mr. Bayly&rsquo;s widow (Bentley, 1844).&nbsp; They saw the light
in the same year as the present critic, and perhaps they ceased
to be very popular before he was breeched.&nbsp; Mr. Bayly,
according to Mrs. Bayly, &ldquo;ably penetrated the sources of
the human heart,&rdquo; like Shakespeare and Mr. Howells.&nbsp;
He also &ldquo;gave to minstrelsy the attributes of intellect and
wit,&rdquo; and &ldquo;reclaimed even festive song from
vulgarity,&rdquo; in which, since the age of Anacreon, festive
song has notoriously wallowed.&nbsp; The poet who did all this
was born at Bath in Oct. 1797.&nbsp; His father was a genteel
solicitor, and his great-grandmother was sister to Lord Delamere,
while he had a remote baronet on the mother&rsquo;s side.&nbsp;
To trace the ancestral source of his genius was difficult, as in
the case of Gifted Hopkins; but it was believed to flow from his
maternal grandfather, Mr. Freeman, whom his friend, Lord
Lavington, regarded as &ldquo;one of the finest poets of his
age.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bayly was at school at Winchester, where he
conducted a weekly college newspaper.&nbsp; His father, like
Scott&rsquo;s, would have made him a lawyer; but &ldquo;the youth
took a great dislike to it, for his ideas loved to dwell in the
regions of fancy,&rdquo; which are closed to attorneys.&nbsp; So
he thought of being a clergyman, and was sent to St. Mary&rsquo;s
Hall, Oxford.&nbsp; There &ldquo;he did not apply himself to the
pursuit of academical honours,&rdquo; but fell in love with a
young lady whose brother he had tended in a fatal illness.&nbsp;
But &ldquo;they were both too wise to think of living upon love,
and, after mutual tears and sighs, they parted never to meet
again.&nbsp; The lady, though grieved, was not heartbroken, and
soon became the wife of another.&rdquo;&nbsp; They usually
do.&nbsp; Mr. Bayly&rsquo;s regret was more profound, and
expressed itself in the touching ditty:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, no, we never mention her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her name is never heard,<br />
My lips are now forbid to speak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That once familiar word;<br />
From sport to sport they hurry me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To banish my regret,<br />
And when they only worry me&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[I beg Mr. Bayly&rsquo;s pardon]</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And when they win a smile from me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They fancy I forget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They bid me seek in change of scene<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The charms that others see,<br />
But were I in a foreign land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They&rsquo;d find no change in me.<br />
&rsquo;Tis true that I behold no more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The valley where we met;<br />
I do not see the hawthorn tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But how can I forget?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tell me she is happy now,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[And so she was, in fact.]</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gayest of the gay;<br />
They hint that she&rsquo;s forgotten me;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But heed not what they say.<br />
Like me, perhaps, she struggles with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each feeling of regret:<br />
&rsquo;Tis true she&rsquo;s married Mr. Smith,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But, ah, does she forget!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The temptation to parody is really too strong; the last lines,
actually and in an authentic text, are:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But if she loves as I have loved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She never can forget.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bayly had now struck the note, the sweet, sentimental note, of
the early, innocent, Victorian age.&nbsp; Jeames imitated
him:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;R. Hangeline, R. Lady mine,<br />
Dost thou remember Jeames!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should do the trick quite differently now, more like
this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Love spake to me and said:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, lips, be mute;<br />
Let that one name be dead,<br />
That memory flown and fled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Untouched that lute!<br />
Go forth,&rsquo; said Love, &lsquo;with willow in thy hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in thy hair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dead blossoms wear,<br />
Blown from the sunless land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go forth,&rsquo; said Love; &lsquo;thou never
more shalt see<br />
Her shadow glimmer by the trysting tree;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But <i>she</i> is glad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With roses crowned and clad,<br />
Who hath forgotten thee!&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But I made answer: &lsquo;Love!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell me no more thereof,<br />
For she has drunk of that same cup as I.<br />
Yea, though her eyes be dry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She garners there for me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tears salter than the sea,<br />
Even till the day she die.&rsquo;<br />
So gave I Love the lie.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I declare I nearly weep over these lines; for, though they are
only Bayly&rsquo;s sentiment hastily recast in a modern manner,
there is something so very affecting, mouldy, and unwholesome
about them, that they sound as if they had been &ldquo;written up
to&rdquo; a sketch by a disciple of Mr. Rossetti&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>In a mood much more manly and moral, Mr. Bayly wrote another
poem to the young lady:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;May thy lot in life be happy, undisturbed
by thoughts of me,<br />
The God who shelters innocence thy guard and guide will be.<br />
Thy heart will lose the chilling sense of hopeless love at
last,<br />
And the sunshine of the future chase the shadows of the
past.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is as easy as prose to sing in this manner.&nbsp; For
example:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In fact, we need not be concerned;
&lsquo;at last&rsquo; comes very soon, and our Emilia quite
forgets the memory of the moon, the moon that shone on her and
us, the woods that heard our vows, the moaning of the waters, and
the murmur of the boughs.&nbsp; She is happy with another, and by
her we&rsquo;re quite forgot; she never lets a thought of us
bring shadow on her lot; and if we meet at dinner she&rsquo;s too
clever to repine, and mentions us to Mr. Smith as &lsquo;An old
flame of mine.&rsquo;&nbsp; And shall I grieve that it is thus?
and would I have her weep, and lose her healthy appetite and
break her healthy sleep?&nbsp; Not so, she&rsquo;s not poetical,
though ne&rsquo;er shall I forget the fairy of my fancy whom I
once thought I had met.&nbsp; The fairy of my fancy!&nbsp; It was
fancy, most things are; her emotions were not steadfast as the
shining of a star; but, ah, I love her image yet, as once it
shone on me, and swayed me as the low moon sways the surging of
the sea.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among other sports his anxious friends hurried the lovelorn
Bayly to Scotland, where he wrote much verse, and then to Dublin,
which completed his cure.&nbsp; &ldquo;He seemed in the midst of
the crowd the gayest of all, his laughter rang merry and loud at
banquet and hall.&rdquo;&nbsp; He thought no more of studying for
the Church, but went back to Bath, met a Miss Hayes, was
fascinated by Miss Hayes, &ldquo;came, saw, but did <i>not</i>
conquer at once,&rdquo; says Mrs. Haynes Bayly (<i>n&eacute;e</i>
Hayes) with widow&rsquo;s pride.&nbsp; Her lovely name was
Helena; and I deeply regret to add that, after an education at
Oxford, Mr. Bayly, in his poems, accentuated the penultimate,
which, of course, is short.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, think not, Helena, of leaving us
yet,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he carolled, when it would have been just as easy, and a
hundred times more correct, to sing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, Helena, think not of leaving us
yet.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miss Hayes had lands in Ireland, alas! and Mr. Bayly
insinuated that, like King Easter and King Wester in the ballad,
her lovers courted her for her lands and her fee; but he, like
King Honour,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For her bonny face<br />
And for her fair bodie.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1825 (after being elected to the Athen&aelig;um) Mr. Bayly
&ldquo;at last found favour in the eyes of Miss
Hayes.&rdquo;&nbsp; He presented her with a little ruby heart,
which she accepted, and they were married, and at first were
well-to-do, Miss Hayes being the heiress of Benjamin Hayes, Esq.,
of Marble Hill, in county Cork.&nbsp; A friend of Mr.
Bayly&rsquo;s described him thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I never have met on this chilling earth<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; So merry, so kind, so frank a youth,<br />
In moments of pleasure a smile all mirth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In moments of sorrow a heart of truth.<br />
I have heard thee praised, I have seen thee led<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By Fashion along her gay career;<br />
While beautiful lips have often shed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their flattering poison in thine ear.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet he says that the poet was unspoiled.&nbsp; On his
honeymoon, at Lord Ashdown&rsquo;s, Mr. Bayly, flying from some
fair sirens, retreated to a bower, and there wrote his
world-famous &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be a Butterfly.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be a butterfly, living a
rover,<br />
Dying when fair things are fading away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The place in which the deathless strains welled from the
singer&rsquo;s heart was henceforth known as &ldquo;Butterfly
Bower.&rdquo;&nbsp; He now wrote a novel, &ldquo;The
Aylmers,&rdquo; which has gone where the old moons go, and he
became rather a literary lion, and made the acquaintance of
Theodore Hook.&nbsp; The loss of a son caused him to write some
devotional verses, which were not what he did best; and now he
began to try comedies.&nbsp; One of them, <i>Sold for a Song</i>,
succeeded very well.&nbsp; In the stage-coach between Wycombe
Abbey and London he wrote a successful little <i>lever de
rideau</i> called <i>Perfection</i>; and it was lucky that he
opened this vein, for his wife&rsquo;s Irish property got into an
Irish bog of dishonesty and difficulty.&nbsp; Thirty-five pieces
were contributed by him to the British stage.&nbsp; After a long
illness, he died on April 22nd, 1829.&nbsp; He did not live, this
butterfly minstrel, into the winter of human age.</p>
<p>Of his poems the inevitable criticism must be that he was a
Tom Moore of much lower accomplishments.&nbsp; His business was
to carol of the most vapid and obvious sentiment, and to string
flowers, fruits, trees, breeze, sorrow, to-morrow, knights,
coal-black steeds, regret, deception, and so forth, into fervid
anap&aelig;stics.&nbsp; Perhaps his success lay in knowing
exactly how little sense in poetry composers will endure and
singers will accept.&nbsp; Why, &ldquo;words for music&rdquo; are
almost invariably trash now, though the words of Elizabethan
songs are better than any music, is a gloomy and difficult
question.&nbsp; Like most poets, I myself detest the sister art,
and don&rsquo;t know anything about it.&nbsp; But any one can see
that words like Bayly&rsquo;s are and have long been much more
popular with musical people than words like Shelley&rsquo;s,
Keats&rsquo;s, Shakespeare&rsquo;s, Fletcher&rsquo;s,
Lovelace&rsquo;s, or Carew&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The natural explanation
is not flattering to musical people: at all events, the singing
world doted on Bayly.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;She never blamed him&mdash;never,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But received him when he came<br />
With a welcome sort of shiver,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And she tried to look the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But vainly she dissembled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For whene&rsquo;er she tried to smile,<br />
A tear unbidden trembled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In her blue eye all the while.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was pleasant for &ldquo;him&rdquo;; but the point is that
these are lines to an Indian air.&nbsp; Shelley, also, about the
same time, wrote Lines to an Indian air; but we may &ldquo;swear,
and save our oath,&rdquo; that the singers preferred
Bayly&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Tennyson and Coleridge could never equal the
popularity of what follows.&nbsp; I shall ask the persevering
reader to tell me where Bayly ends, and where parody begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When the eye of beauty closes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the weary are at rest,<br />
When the shade the sunset throws is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But a vapour in the west;<br />
When the moonlight tips the billow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a wreath of silver foam,<br />
And the whisper of the willow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Breaks the slumber of the gnome,&mdash;<br />
Night may come, but sleep will linger,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the spirit, all forlorn,<br />
Shuts its ear against the singer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the rustle of the corn<br />
Round the sad old mansion sobbing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bids the wakeful maid recall<br />
Who it was that caused the throbbing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of her bosom at the ball.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Will this not do to sing just as well as the original? and is
it not true that &ldquo;almost any man you please could reel it
off for days together&rdquo;?&nbsp; Anything will do that speaks
of forgetting people, and of being forsaken, and about the
sunset, and the ivy, and the rose.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tell me no more that the tide of thine
anguish<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is red as the heart&rsquo;s blood and salt as the
sea;<br />
That the stars in their courses command thee to languish,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the hand of enjoyment is loosened from
thee!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me no more that, forgotten, forsaken,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou roamest the wild wood, thou sigh&rsquo;st on
the shore.<br />
Nay, rent is the pledge that of old we had taken,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the words that have bound me, they bind thee no
more!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ere the sun had gone down on thy sorrow, the maidens<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were wreathing the orange&rsquo;s bud in thy
hair,<br />
And the trumpets were tuning the musical cadence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That gave thee, a bride, to the baronet&rsquo;s
heir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, may no thought pierce thy breast of thy
treason;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Farewell, and be happy in Hubert&rsquo;s embrace.<br
/>
Be the belle of the ball, be the bride of the season,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With diamonds bedizened and languid in
lace.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is mine, and I say, with modest pride, that it is quite
as good as&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Go, may&rsquo;st thou be happy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though sadly we part,<br />
In life&rsquo;s early summer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grief breaks not the heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ills that assail us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As speedily pass<br />
As shades o&rsquo;er a mirror,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which stain not the glass.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anybody could do it, we say, in what Edgar Poe calls
&ldquo;the mad pride of intellectuality,&rdquo; and it certainly
looks as if it could be done by anybody.&nbsp; For example, take
Bayly as a moralist.&nbsp; His ideas are out of the centre.&nbsp;
This is about his standard:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;CRUELTY.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Break not the thread the spider<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is labouring to weave.&rsquo;<br />
I said, nor as I eyed her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could dream she would deceive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her brow was pure and candid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her tender eyes above;<br />
And I, if ever man did,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fell hopelessly in love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For who could deem that cruel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So fair a face might be?<br />
That eyes so like a jewel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were only paste for me?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wove my thread, aspiring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within her heart to climb;<br />
I wove with zeal untiring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For ever such a time!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, ah! that thread was broken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All by her fingers fair,<br />
The vows and prayers I&rsquo;ve spoken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are vanished into air!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did Bayly write that ditty or did I?&nbsp; Upon my word, I can
hardly tell.&nbsp; I am being hypnotised by Bayly.&nbsp; I lisp
in numbers, and the numbers come like mad.&nbsp; I can hardly ask
for a light without abounding in his artless vein.&nbsp; Easy,
easy it seems; and yet it was Bayly after all, not you nor I, who
wrote the classic&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hang my harp on a willow
tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll go to the war again,<br />
For a peaceful home has no charm for me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A battlefield no pain;<br />
The lady I love will soon be a bride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a diadem on her brow.<br />
Ah, why did she flatter my boyish pride?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She is going to leave me now!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is like listening, in the sad yellow evening, to the
strains of a barrel organ, faint and sweet, and far away.&nbsp; A
world of memories come jigging back&mdash;foolish fancies,
dreams, desires, all beckoning and bobbing to the old tune:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh had I but loved with a boyish love,<br
/>
It would have been well for me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does Bayly manage it?&nbsp; What is the trick of it, the
obvious, simple, meretricious trick, which somehow, after all,
let us mock as we will, Bayly could do, and we cannot?&nbsp; He
really had a slim, serviceable, smirking, and sighing little
talent of his own; and&mdash;well, we have not even that.&nbsp;
Nobody forgets</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The lady I love will soon be a
bride.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nobody remembers our cultivated epics and esoteric sonnets, oh
brother minor poet, <i>mon semblable</i>, <i>mon
fr&egrave;re</i>!&nbsp; Nor can we rival, though we publish our
books on the largest paper, the buried popularity of</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Gaily the troubadour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Touched his guitar<br />
When he was hastening<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Home from the war,<br />
Singing, &ldquo;From Palestine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hither I come,<br />
Lady love!&nbsp; Lady love!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome me home!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course this is, historically, a very incorrect rendering of
a Languedoc crusader; and the impression is not medi&aelig;val,
but of the comic opera.&nbsp; Any one of us could get in more
local colour for the money, and give the crusader a cithern or
citole instead of a guitar.&nbsp; This is how we should do
&ldquo;Gaily the Troubadour&rdquo; nowadays:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir Ralph he is hardy and mickle of
might,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Ha</i>, <i>la belle blanche
aub&eacute;pine</i>!<br />
Soldans seven hath he slain in fight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Honneur &agrave; la belle Isoline</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Ralph he rideth in riven mail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Ha</i>, <i>la belle blanche
aub&eacute;pine</i>!<br />
Beneath his nasal is his dark face pale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Honneur &agrave; la belle Isoline</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;His eyes they blaze as the burning coal,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Ha</i>, <i>la belle blanche
aub&eacute;pine</i>!<br />
He smiteth a stave on his gold citole,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Honneur &agrave; la belle Isoline</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;From her mangonel she looketh forth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Ha</i>, <i>la belle blanche
aub&eacute;pine</i>!<br />
&lsquo;Who is he spurreth so late to the north?&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Honneur &agrave; la belle Isoline</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark! for he speaketh a knightly name,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Ha</i>, <i>la belle blanche
aub&eacute;pine</i>!<br />
And her wan cheek glows as a burning flame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Honneur &agrave; la belle Isoline</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Sir Ralph he is hardy and mickle of might,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Ha</i>, <i>la belle blanche
aub&eacute;pine</i>!<br />
And his love shall ungirdle his sword to-night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Honneur &agrave; la belle Isoline</i>!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such is the romantic, esoteric, old French way of
saying&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hark, &rsquo;tis the troubadour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathing her name<br />
Under the battlement<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Softly he came,<br />
Singing, &ldquo;From Palestine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hither I come.<br />
Lady love!&nbsp; Lady love!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome me home!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The moral of all this is that minor poetry has its fashions,
and that the butterfly Bayly could versify very successfully in
the fashion of a time simpler and less pedantic than our
own.&nbsp; On the whole, minor poetry for minor poetry, this
artless singer, piping his native drawing-room notes, gave a
great deal of perfectly harmless, if highly uncultivated,
enjoyment.</p>
<p>It must not be fancied that Mr. Bayly had only one string to
his bow&mdash;or, rather, to his lyre.&nbsp; He wrote a great
deal, to be sure, about the passion of love, which Count
Tolsto&iuml; thinks we make too much of.&nbsp; He did not dream
that the affairs of the heart should be regulated by the
State&mdash;by the Permanent Secretary of the Marriage
Office.&nbsp; That is what we are coming to, of course, unless
the enthusiasts of &ldquo;free love&rdquo; and &ldquo;go away as
you please&rdquo; failed with their little programme.&nbsp; No
doubt there would be poetry if the State regulated or left wholly
unregulated the affections of the future.&nbsp; Mr. Bayly, living
in other times, among other manners, piped of the hard tyranny of
a mother:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We met, &rsquo;twas in a crowd, and I
thought he would shun me.<br />
He came, I could not breathe, for his eye was upon me.<br />
He spoke, his words were cold, and his smile was unaltered,<br />
I knew how much he felt, for his deep-toned voice faltered.<br />
I wore my bridal robe, and I rivalled its whiteness;<br />
Bright gems were in my hair,&mdash;how I hated their
brightness!<br />
He called me by my name as the bride of another.<br />
Oh, thou hast been the cause of this anguish, my
mother!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In future, when the reformers of marriage have had their way,
we shall read:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The world may think me gay, for I bow to my
fate;<br />
But thou hast been the cause of my anguish, O State!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For even when true love is regulated by the County Council or
the village community, it will still persist in not running
smooth.</p>
<p>Of these passions, then, Mr. Bayly could chant; but let us
remember that he could also dally with old romance, that he
wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The mistletoe hung in the castle hall,<br
/>
The holly branch shone on the old oak wall.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the bride unluckily got into the ancient chest,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It closed with a spring.&nbsp; And,
dreadful doom,<br />
The bride lay clasped in her living tomb,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so that her lover &ldquo;mourned for his fairy bride,&rdquo;
and never found out her premature casket.&nbsp; This was true
romance as understood when Peel was consul.&nbsp; Mr. Bayly was
rarely political; but he commemorated the heroes of Waterloo, our
last victory worth mentioning:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Yet mourn not for them, for in future
tradition<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their fame shall abide as our tutelar star,<br />
<i>To instil by example the glorious ambition</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Of falling</i>, <i>like them</i>, <i>in a
glorious war</i>.<br />
Though tears may be seen in the bright eyes of beauty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One consolation must ever remain:<br />
Undaunted they trod in the pathway of duty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which led them to glory on Waterloo&rsquo;s
plain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could there be a more simple Tyrt&aelig;us? and who that reads
him will not be ambitious of falling in a glorious war?&nbsp;
Bayly, indeed, is always simple.&nbsp; He is &ldquo;simple,
sensuous, and passionate,&rdquo; and Milton asked no more from a
poet.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A wreath of orange blossoms,<br />
When next we met, she wore.<br />
<i>The expression of her features</i><br />
<i>Was more thoughtful than before</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On his own principles Wordsworth should have admired this
unaffected statement; but Wordsworth rarely praised his
contemporaries, and said that &ldquo;Guy Mannering&rdquo; was a
respectable effort in the style of Mrs. Radcliffe.&nbsp; Nor did
he even extol, though it is more in his own line,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of what is the old man thinking,<br />
As he leans on his oaken staff?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My own favourite among Mr. Bayly&rsquo;s effusions is not a
sentimental ode, but the following gush of true natural
feeling:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, give me new faces, new faces, new
faces,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen those around me a fortnight and
more.<br />
Some people grow weary of things or of places,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But persons to me are a much greater bore.<br />
I care not for features, I&rsquo;m sure to discover<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some exquisite trait in the first that you send.<br
/>
My fondness falls off when the novelty&rsquo;s over;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I want a new face for an intimate friend.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is perfectly candid: we should all prefer a new face, if
pretty, every fortnight:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Come, I pray you, and tell me this,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All good fellows whose beards are grey,<br />
Did not the fairest of the fair<br />
Common grow and wearisome ere<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever a month had passed away?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For once Mr. Bayly uttered in his &ldquo;New Faces&rdquo; a
sentiment not usually expressed, but universally felt; and now he
suffers, as a poet, because he is no longer a new face, because
we have welcomed his juniors.&nbsp; To Bayly we shall not return;
but he has one rare merit,&mdash;he is always perfectly
plain-spoken and intelligible.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Farewell to my Bayly, farewell to the
singer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose tender effusions my aunts used to sing;<br />
Farewell, for the fame of the bard does not linger,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My favourite minstrel&rsquo;s no longer the
thing.<br />
But though on his temples has faded the laurel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though broken the lute, and though veiled is the
crest,<br />
My Bayly, at worst, is uncommonly moral,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which is more than some new poets are, at their
best.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Farewell to our Bayly, about whose songs we may say, with Mr.
Thackeray in &ldquo;Vanity Fair,&rdquo; that &ldquo;they contain
numberless good-natured, simple appeals to the
affections.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are no longer affectionate,
good-natured, simple.&nbsp; We are cleverer than Bayly&rsquo;s
audience; but are we better fellows?</p>
<h2>TH&Eacute;ODORE DE BANVILLE</h2>
<p>There are literary reputations in France and England which
seem, like the fairies, to be unable to cross running
water.&nbsp; Dean Swift, according to M. Paul de Saint-Victor, is
a great man at Dover, a pigmy at Calais&mdash;&ldquo;Son talent,
qui enthousiasme l&rsquo;Angleterre, n&rsquo;inspire ailleurs
qu&rsquo;un morne &eacute;tonnement.&rdquo;&nbsp; M. Paul De
Saint-Victor was a fair example of the French critic, and what he
says about Swift was possibly true,&mdash;for him.&nbsp; There is
not much resemblance between the Dean and M. Th&eacute;odore de
Banville, except that the latter too is a poet who has little
honour out of his own country.&nbsp; He is a charming singer at
Calais; at Dover he inspires <i>un morne &eacute;tonnement</i> (a
bleak perplexity).&nbsp; One has never seen an English attempt to
describe or estimate his genius.&nbsp; His unpopularity in
England is illustrated by the fact that the London Library, that
respectable institution, does not, or did not, possess a single
copy of any one of his books.&nbsp; He is but feebly represented
even in the collection of the British Museum.&nbsp; It is not
hard to account for our indifference to M. De Banville.&nbsp; He
is a poet not only intensely French, but intensely
Parisian.&nbsp; He is careful of form, rather than abundant in
manner.&nbsp; He has no story to tell, and his sketches in prose,
his attempts at criticism, are not very weighty or
instructive.&nbsp; With all his limitations, however, he
represents, in company with M. Leconte de Lisle, the second of
the three generations of poets over whom Victor Hugo reigned.</p>
<p>M. De Banville has been called, by people who do not like, and
who apparently have not read him, <i>un saltimbanque
litt&eacute;raire</i> (a literary rope-dancer).&nbsp; Other
critics, who do like him, but who have limited their study to a
certain portion of his books, compare him to a worker in gold,
who carefully chases or embosses dainty processions of fauns and
m&aelig;nads.&nbsp; He is, in point of fact, something more
estimable than a literary rope-dancer, something more serious
than a working jeweller in rhymes.&nbsp; He calls himself <i>un
raffin&eacute;</i>; but he is not, like many persons who are
proud of that title, <i>un indiff&eacute;rent</i> in matters of
human fortune.&nbsp; His earlier poems, of course, are much
concerned with the matter of most early poems&mdash;with Lydia
and Cynthia and their light loves.&nbsp; The verses of his second
period often deal with the most evanescent subjects, and they now
retain but a slight petulance and sparkle, as of champagne that
has been too long drawn.&nbsp; In a prefatory plea for M. De
Banville&rsquo;s poetry one may add that he &ldquo;has loved our
people,&rdquo; and that no poet, no critic, has honoured
Shakespeare with brighter words of praise.</p>
<p>Th&eacute;odore de Banville was born at Moulin, on March 14th
1823, and he is therefore three years younger than the
dictionaries of biography would make the world believe.&nbsp; He
is the son of a naval officer, and, according to M. Charles
Baudelaire, a descendant of the Crusaders.&nbsp; He came much too
late into the world to distinguish himself in the noisy exploits
of 1830, and the chief event of his youth was the publication of
&ldquo;Les Cariatides&rdquo; in 1842.&nbsp; This first volume
contained a selection from the countless verses which the poet
produced between his sixteenth and his nineteenth year.&nbsp;
Whatever other merits the songs of minors may possess, they have
seldom that of permitting themselves to be read.&nbsp; &ldquo;Les
Cariatides&rdquo; are exceptional here.&nbsp; They are, above all
things, readable.&nbsp; &ldquo;On peut les lire &agrave; peu de
frais,&rdquo; M. De Banville says himself.&nbsp; He admits that
his lighter works, the poems called (in England) <i>vers de
soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i>, are a sort of intellectual
cigarette.&nbsp; M. Emile de Girardin said, in the later days of
the Empire, that there were too many cigarettes in the air.&nbsp;
Their stale perfume clings to the literature of that time, as the
odour of pastilles yet hangs about the verse of Dorat, the
designs of Eisen, the work of the Pompadour period.&nbsp; There
is more than smoke in M. De Banville&rsquo;s ruling inspiration,
his lifelong devotion to letters and to great men of
letters&mdash;Shakespeare, Moli&egrave;re, Homer, Victor
Hugo.&nbsp; These are his gods; the memory of them is his
muse.&nbsp; His enthusiasm is worthy of one who, though born too
late to see and know the noble wildness of 1830, yet lives on the
recollections, and is strengthened by the example, of that
revival of letters.&nbsp; Whatever one may say of the
<i>renouveau</i>, of romanticism, with its affectations, the
young men of 1830 were sincere in their devotion to liberty, to
poetry, to knowledge.&nbsp; One can hardly find a more brilliant
and touching belief in these great causes than that of Edgar
Quinet, as displayed in the letters of his youth.&nbsp; De
Banville fell on more evil times.</p>
<p>When &ldquo;Les Cariatides&rdquo; was published poets had
begun to keep an eye on the Bourse, and artists dabbled in
finance.&nbsp; The new volume of song in the sordid age was a
November primrose, and not unlike the flower of Spring.&nbsp;
There was a singular freshness and hopefulness in the verse, a
wonderful &ldquo;certitude dans l&rsquo;expression
lyrique,&rdquo; as Sainte-Beuve said.&nbsp; The mastery of
musical speech and of various forms of song was already to be
recognised as the basis and the note of the talent of De
Banville.&nbsp; He had style, without which a man may write very
nice verses about heaven and hell and other matters, and may
please thousands of excellent people, but will write
poetry&mdash;never.&nbsp; Comparing De Banville&rsquo;s
boy&rsquo;s work with the boy&rsquo;s work of Mr. Tennyson, one
observes in each&mdash;&ldquo;Les Cariatides&rdquo; as in
&ldquo;The Hesperides&rdquo;&mdash;the <i>timbre</i> of a new
voice.&nbsp; Poetry so fresh seems to make us aware of some want
which we had hardly recognised, but now are sensible of, at the
moment we find it satisfied.</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to say that this gratifying and welcome
strangeness, this lyric originality, is nearly all that M. De
Banville has in common with the English poet whose two priceless
volumes were published in the same year as &ldquo;Les
Cariatides?&rdquo;&nbsp; The melody of Mr. Tennyson&rsquo;s
lines, the cloudy palaces of his imagination, rose</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As Ilion, like a mist rose into
towers,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when Apollo sang.&nbsp; The architecture was floating at
first, and confused; while the little theatre of M. De
Banville&rsquo;s poetry, where he sat piping to a dance of
nixies, was brilliantly lit and elegant with fresh paint and
gilding.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Cariatides&rdquo; support the pediment
and roof of a theatre or temple in the Graeco-French style.&nbsp;
The poet proposed to himself</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A c&ocirc;t&eacute; de V&eacute;nus et du
fils de Latone<br />
Peindre la f&eacute;e et la p&eacute;ri.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The longest poem in the book, and the most serious, &ldquo;La
Voie Lact&eacute;e,&rdquo; reminds one of the &ldquo;Palace of
Art,&rdquo; written before the after-thought, before the
&ldquo;white-eyed corpses&rdquo; were found lurking in
corners.&nbsp; Beginning with Homer, &ldquo;the Ionian father of
the rest,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ce dieu, p&egrave;re des dieux
qu&rsquo;adore Ionie,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the poet glorifies all the chief names of song.&nbsp; There is
a long procession of illustrious shadows before Shakespeare
comes&mdash;Shakespeare, whose genius includes them all.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Toute cr&eacute;ation &agrave; laquelle on
aspire,<br />
Tout r&ecirc;ve, toute chose, &eacute;manent de
Shakespeare.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His mind has lent colour to the flowers and the sky, to</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;La fleur qui brode un point sur les manteau
des plaines,<br />
Les n&eacute;nuphars pench&eacute;s, et les p&acirc;les
roseaux<br />
Qui disent leur chant sombre au murmure des eaux.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One recognises more sincerity in this hymn to all poets, from
Orpheus to Heine, than in &ldquo;Les Baisers de
Pierre&rdquo;&mdash;a clever imitation of De Musset&rsquo;s
stories in verse.&nbsp; Love of art and of the masters of art, a
passion for the figures of old mythology, which had returned
again after their exile in 1830, gaiety, and a revival of the
dexterity of Villon and Marot,&mdash;these things are the
characteristics of M. De Banville&rsquo;s genius, and all these
were displayed in &ldquo;Les Cariatides.&rdquo;&nbsp; Already,
too, his preoccupation with the lighter and more fantastic sort
of theatrical amusements shows itself in lines like these:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;De son lit &agrave; baldaquin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Le soleil de son beau globe<br />
Avait l&rsquo;air d&rsquo;un arlequin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Etalant sa garde-robe;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Et sa soeur au front changeant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mademoiselle la Lune<br />
Avec ses grands yeux d&rsquo;argent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardait la terre brune.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verse about &ldquo;the sun in bed,&rdquo; unconsciously
Miltonic, is in a vein of bad taste which has always had
seductions for M. De Banville.&nbsp; He mars a fine later poem on
Roncevaux and Roland by a similar absurdity.&nbsp; The angel
Michael is made to stride down the steps of heaven four at a
time, and M. De Banville fancies that this sort of thing is like
the simplicity of the ages of faith.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Les Cariatides,&rdquo; especially in the poems
styled &ldquo;En Habit Zinzolin,&rdquo; M. De Banville revived
old measures&mdash;the <i>rondeau</i> and the &ldquo;poor little
triolet.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are forms of verse which it is easy
to write badly, and hard indeed to write well.&nbsp; They have
knocked at the door of the English muse&rsquo;s garden&mdash;a
runaway knock.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Les Cariatides&rdquo; they took a
subordinate place, and played their pranks in the shadow of the
grave figures of mythology, or at the close of the procession of
Dionysus and his M&aelig;nads.&nbsp; De Banville often recalls
Keats in his choice of classical themes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Les
Exil&eacute;s,&rdquo; a poem of his maturity, is a French
&ldquo;Hyperion.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Le Triomphe de
Bacchus&rdquo; reminds one of the song of the Bassarids in
&ldquo;Endymion&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So many, and so many, and so
gay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a pretty touch of the pedant (who exists, says M. De
Banville, in the heart of the poet) in this verse:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Il r&ecirc;ve &agrave; Cama, l&rsquo;amour
aux cinq fl&egrave;ches fleuries,<br />
Qui, lorsque soupire au milieu des roses prairies<br />
La douce Vasanta, parmi les bosquets de santal,<br />
Envoie aux cinq sens les fl&egrave;ches du carquois
fatal.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bacchus of Titian has none of this Oriental languor, no
memories of perfumed places where &ldquo;the throne of Indian
Cama slowly sails.&rdquo;&nbsp; One cannot help admiring the
fancy which saw the conquering god still steeped in Asiatic ease,
still unawakened to more vigorous passion by the fresh wind
blowing from Thrace.&nbsp; Of all the Olympians, Diana has been
most often hymned by M. De Banville: his imagination is haunted
by the figure of the goddess.&nbsp; Now she is manifest in her
Hellenic aspect, as Homer beheld her, &ldquo;taking her pastime
in the chase of boars and swift deer; and with her the wild
wood-nymphs are sporting the daughters of Zeus; and Leto is glad
at heart, for her child towers over them all, and is easy to be
known where all are fair&rdquo; (Odyssey, vi.).&nbsp; Again,
Artemis appears more thoughtful, as in the sculpture of Jean
Goujon, touched with the sadness of moonlight.&nbsp; Yet again,
she is the weary and exiled spirit that haunts the forest of
Fontainebleau, and is a stranger among the woodland folk, the
<i>fades</i> and nixies.&nbsp; To this goddess, &ldquo;being
triple in her divided deity,&rdquo; M. De Banville has written
his hymn in the characteristic form of the old French
<i>ballade</i>.&nbsp; The translator may borrow Chaucer&rsquo;s
apology&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And eke to me it is a grete penaunce,<br />
Syth rhyme in English hath such scarsete<br />
To folowe, word by word, the curiosite<br />
Of <i>Banville</i>, flower of them that make in
France.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;BALLADE SUR LES H&Ocirc;TES
MYST&Eacute;RIEUX DE LA FOR&Ecirc;T</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still sing the mocking fairies, as of old,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath the shade of thorn and holly tree;<br />
The west wind breathes upon them pure and cold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And still wolves dread Diana roving free,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In secret woodland with her
company.<br />
Tis thought the peasants&rsquo; hovels know her rite<br />
When now the wolds are bathed in silver light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And first the moonrise breaks the dusky grey,<br />
Then down the dells, with blown soft hair and bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And through the dim wood Dian thrids her way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With water-weeds twined in their locks of gold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The strange cold forest-fairies dance in glee;<br />
Sylphs over-timorous and over-bold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Haunt the dark hollows where the dwarf may be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wild red dwarf, the
nixies&rsquo; enemy;<br />
Then, &rsquo;mid their mirth, and laughter, and affright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sudden goddess enters, tall and white,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With one long sigh for summers
passed away;<br />
The swift feet tear the ivy nets outright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And through the dim wood Dian thrids her way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She gleans her sylvan trophies; down the wold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She hears the sobbing of the stags that flee,<br />
Mixed with the music of the hunting rolled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But her delight is all in archery,<br />
And nought of ruth and pity wotteth she<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More than the hounds that follow on the flight;<br
/>
The tall nymph draws a golden bow of might,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thick she rains the gentle shafts that slay,<br
/>
She tosses loose her locks upon the night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Dian through the dim wood thrids her way.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Envoi</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince, let us leave the din, the dust, the spite,<br

The gloom and glare of towns, the plague, the blight;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Amid the forest leaves and fountain spray<br />
There is the mystic home of our delight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And through the dim wood Dian thrids her
way.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The piece is characteristic of M. De Banville&rsquo;s
genius.&nbsp; Through his throng of operatic nixies and sylphs of
the ballet the cold Muse sometimes passes, strange, but not
unfriendly.&nbsp; He, for his part, has never degraded the
beautiful forms of old religion to make the laughing-stock of
fools.&nbsp; His little play, <i>Diane au Bois</i>, has grace,
and gravity, and tenderness like the tenderness of Keats, for the
failings of immortals.&nbsp; &ldquo;The gods are jealous
exceedingly if any goddess takes a mortal man to her paramour, as
Demeter chose Iasion.&rdquo;&nbsp; The least that mortal poets
can do is to show the Olympians an example of toleration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Les Cariatides&rdquo; have delayed us too long.&nbsp;
They are wonderfully varied, vigorous, and rich, and full of
promise in many ways.&nbsp; The promise has hardly been
kept.&nbsp; There is more seriousness in &ldquo;Les
Stalactites&rdquo; (1846), it is true, but then there is less
daring.&nbsp; There is one morsel that must be quoted,&mdash;a
fragment fashioned on the air and the simple words that used to
waken the musings of George Sand when she was a child, dancing
with the peasant children:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nous n&rsquo;irons plus an bois: les
lauries sont coup&eacute;s,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Les amours des bassins, les na&iuml;ades en
groupe<br />

/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Les flots silencieux qui coulaient de leur coupe,<br
/>
Les lauriers sont coup&eacute;s et le cerf aux abois<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tressaille au son du cor: nous n&rsquo;irons plus au

&nbsp;&nbsp; Parmi les lys d&rsquo;argent aux pleurs du ciel
tremp&eacute;s,<br />
Voici l&rsquo;herbe qu&rsquo;on fauche et les lauriers
qu&rsquo;on coupe;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nous n&rsquo;irons plus au bois; les lauriers sont
coup&eacute;s.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In these days Banville, like G&eacute;rard de Nerval in
earlier times, <span class="smcap">ronsardised</span>.&nbsp; The
poem &lsquo;&Agrave; la Font Georges,&rsquo; full of the memories
of childhood, sweet and rich with the air and the hour of sunset,
is written in a favourite metre of Ronsard&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Thus
Ronsard says in his lyrical version of five famous lines of
Homer&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;La gresle ni la neige<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; N&rsquo;ont tels lieux pour leur si&eacute;ge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ne la foudre oncques l&agrave;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ne
d&eacute;vala.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(The snow, and wind, and hail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May never there prevail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor thunderbolt doth fall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor rain at
all.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>De Banville chose this metre, rapid yet melancholy, with its
sad emphatic cadence in the fourth line, as the vehicle of his
childish memories:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O champs pleins de silence,<br />
O&ugrave; mon heureuse enfance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avait des jours encor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tout fil&eacute;s
d&rsquo;or!&rdquo;</p>
<p>O ma vieille Font Georges,<br />
Vers qui les rouges-gorges<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Et le doux rossignol<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prenaient leur vol!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this poem of the fountain of youth begins, &ldquo;tout
fil&eacute; d&rsquo;or,&rdquo; and closes when the dusk is washed
with silver&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&Agrave; l&rsquo;heure o&ugrave; sous leurs
voiles<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Les tremblantes &eacute;toiles<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brodent le ciel changeant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; De fleurs
d&rsquo;argent.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;Stalactites&rdquo; might detain one long, but we
must pass on after noticing an unnamed poem which is the French
counterpart of Keats&rsquo; &ldquo;Ode to a Greek Urn&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Qu&rsquo;autour du vase pur, trop beau pour
la Bacchante,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; La verveine, m&ecirc;l&eacute;e &agrave; des
feuilles d&rsquo;acanthe,<br />
Fleurisse, et que plus bas des vierges lentement<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; S&rsquo;avancent deux &agrave; deux, d&rsquo;un pas
sur et charmant,<br />
Les bras pendants le long de leurs tuniques droites<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Et les cheyeux tress&eacute;s sur leurs t&ecirc;tes
&eacute;troites.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same volume of the definite series of poems come
&ldquo;Les Odelettes,&rdquo; charming lyrics, one of which,
addressed to Th&eacute;ophile Gautier, was answered in the
well-known verses called &ldquo;L&rsquo;Art.&rdquo;&nbsp; If
there had been any rivalry between the writers, M. De Banville
would hardly have cared to print Gautier&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Odelette&rdquo; beside his own.&nbsp; The tone of it is
infinitely more manly: one seems to hear a deep, decisive voice
replying to tones far less sweet and serious.&nbsp; M. De
Banville revenged himself nobly in later verses addressed to
Gautier, verses which criticise the genius of that workman
better, we think, than anything else that has been written of him
in prose or rhyme.</p>
<p>The less serious poems of De Banville are, perhaps, the better
known in this country.&nbsp; His feats of graceful metrical
gymnastics have been admired by every one who cares for skill
pure and simple.&nbsp; &ldquo;Les Odes Funambulesques&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Les Occidentales&rdquo; are like ornamental skating.&nbsp;
The author moves in many circles and cuts a hundred fantastic
figures with a perfect ease and smoothness.&nbsp; At the same
time, naturally, he does not advance nor carry his readers with
him in any direction.&nbsp; &ldquo;Les Odes Funambulesques&rdquo;
were at first unsigned.&nbsp; They appeared in journals and
magazines, and, as M. de Banville applied the utmost lyrical
skill to light topics of the moment, they were the most popular
of &ldquo;Articles de Paris.&rdquo;&nbsp; One must admit that
they bore the English reader, and by this time long
<i>scholia</i> are necessary for the enlightenment even of the
Parisian student.&nbsp; The verses are, perhaps, the
&ldquo;bird-chorus&rdquo; of French life, but they have not the
permanent truth and delightfulness of the
&ldquo;bird-chorus&rdquo; in Aristophanes.&nbsp; One has easily
too much of the Carnival, the masked ball, the
<i>d&eacute;bardeurs</i>, and the <i>pierrots</i>.&nbsp; The
people at whom M. De Banville laughed are dead and
forgotten.&nbsp; There was a certain M. Paul Limayrac of those
days, who barked at the heels of Balzac, and other great men, in
the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>.&nbsp; In his honour De Banville
wrote a song which parodied all popular aspirations to be a
flower.&nbsp; M. Limayrac was supposed to have become a
blossom:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sur les c&ocirc;teaux et dans les landes<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Voltigeant comme un oiseleur<br />
Buloz en ferait des guirlandes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Si Limayrac devenait fleur!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is more of high spirits than of wit in the lyric, which
became as popular as our modern invocation of Jingo, the god of
battles.&nbsp; It chanced one night that M. Limayrac appeared at
a masked ball in the opera-house.&nbsp; He was recognised by some
one in the crowd.&nbsp; The turbulent waltz stood still, the
music was silent, and the dancers of every hue howled at the
critic</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Si Paul Limayrac devenait fleur!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fancy a British reviewer, known as such to the British public,
and imagine that public taking a lively interest in the feuds of
men of letters!&nbsp; Paris, to be sure, was more or less of a
university town thirty years ago, and the students were certain
to be largely represented at the ball.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Odes Funambulesques&rdquo; contain many examples of
M. De Banville&rsquo;s skill in reviving old forms of
verse&mdash;<i>triolets</i>, <i>rondeaux</i>, <i>chants
royaux</i>, and <i>ballades</i>.&nbsp; Most of these were
composed for the special annoyance of M. Buloz, M. Limayrac, and
a M. Jacquot who called himself De Mirecourt.&nbsp; The
<i>rondeaux</i> are full of puns in the refrain: &ldquo;Houssaye
ou c&rsquo;est; lyre, l&rsquo;ire, lire,&rdquo; and so on, not
very exhilarating.&nbsp; The <i>pantoum</i>, where lines recur
alternately, was borrowed from the distant Malay; but primitive
<i>pantoum</i>, in which the last two lines of each stanza are
the first two of the next, occur in old French folk-song.&nbsp;
The popular trick of repetition, affording a rest to the memory
of the singer, is perhaps the origin of all refrains.&nbsp; De
Banville&rsquo;s later satires are directed against permanent
objects of human indignation&mdash;the little French
debauch&eacute;e, the hypocritical friend of reaction, the
bloodthirsty <i>chauviniste</i>.&nbsp; Tired of the flashy luxury
of the Empire, his memory goes back to his youth&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lorsque la l&egrave;vre de
l&rsquo;aurore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Baisait nos yeux soulev&eacute;s,<br />
Et que nous n&rsquo;&eacute;tions pas encore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; La France des petits crev&eacute;s.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poem &ldquo;Et Tartufe&rdquo; prolongs the note of a
satire always popular in France&mdash;the satire of Scarron,
Moli&egrave;re, La Bruy&egrave;re, against the clerical curse of
the nation.&nbsp; The Roman Question was Tartufe&rsquo;s
stronghold at the moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;French interests&rdquo;
demanded that Italy should be headless.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Et Tartufe?&nbsp; Il nous dit entre deux
cr&eacute;mus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Que pour tout bon Fran&ccedil;ais l&rsquo;empire est
&agrave; Rome,<br />
Et qu&rsquo;ayant pour a&iuml;eux Romulus et R&eacute;mus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nous tetterons la louve &agrave; jamais&mdash;le
pauvre homme.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new Tartufe worships St. Chassepot, who once, it will not
be forgotten, &ldquo;wrought miracles&rdquo;; but he has his
doubts as to the morality of explosive bullets.&nbsp; The nymph
of modern warfare is addressed as she hovers above the Geneva
Convention,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Quoi, nymphe du canon ray&eacute;,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tu montres ces pudeurs risibles<br />
Et ce petit air effray&eacute;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Devant les balles exploisibles?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>De Banville was for long almost alone among poets in his
freedom from <i>Weltschmerz</i>, from regret and desire for
worlds lost or impossible.&nbsp; In the later and stupider
corruption of the Empire, sadness and anger began to vex even his
careless muse.&nbsp; She had piped in her time to much wild
dancing, but could not sing to a waltz of mushroom speculators
and decorated capitalists.&nbsp; &ldquo;Le Sang de la
Coupe&rdquo; contains a very powerful poem, &ldquo;The Curse of
Venus,&rdquo; pronounced on Paris, the city of pleasure, which
has become the city of greed.&nbsp; This verse is appropriate to
our own commercial enterprise:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Vends les bois o&ugrave; dormaient Viviane
et Merlin!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; L&rsquo;Aigle de mont n&rsquo;est fait que pour ta
gibeci&egrave;re;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; La neige vierge est l&agrave; pour fournir ta
glaci&egrave;re;<br />
Le torrent qui bondit sur le roc sybillin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Et vole, diamant, neige, &eacute;cume et
poussi&egrave;re,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; N&rsquo;est plus bon qu&rsquo;&agrave; tourner tes
meules de moulin!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the burning indignation of this poem, M. De Banville
reaches his highest mark of attainment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Les
Exil&eacute;s&rdquo; is scarcely less impressive.&nbsp; The
outcast gods of Hellas, wandering in a forest of ancient Gaul,
remind one at once of the fallen deities of Heine, the decrepit
Olympians of Bruno, and the large utterance of Keats&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Hyperion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among great exiles, Victor Hugo,
&ldquo;le p&egrave;re l&agrave;-bas dans
l&rsquo;&icirc;le,&rdquo; is not forgotten:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Et toi qui l&rsquo;accueillis, sol libre et
verdoyant,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Qui prodigues les fleurs sur tes c&ocirc;teaux
fertiles,<br />
Et qui sembles sourire &agrave; l&rsquo;oc&eacute;an bruyant,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sois b&eacute;nie, &icirc;le verte, entre toutes les
&icirc;les.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hoarsest note of M. De Banville&rsquo;s lyre is that
discordant one struck in the &ldquo;Idylles
Prussiennes.&rdquo;&nbsp; One would not linger over poetry or
prose composed during the siege, in hours of shame and impotent
scorn.&nbsp; The poet sings how the sword, the flashing Durendal,
is rusted and broken, how victory is to him&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo; . . . qui se cela<br />
Dans un trou, sous la terre noire.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He can spare a tender lyric to the memory of a Prussian
officer, a lad of eighteen, shot dead through a volume of Pindar
which he carried in his tunic.</p>
<p>It is impossible to leave the poet of gaiety and good-humour
in the mood of the prisoner in besieged Paris.&nbsp; His
&ldquo;Trente Six Ballades Joyeuses&rdquo; make a far more
pleasant subject for a last word.&nbsp; There is scarcely a more
delightful little volume in the French language than this
collection of verses in the most difficult of forms, which pour
forth, with absolute ease and fluency, notes of mirth, banter,
joy in the spring, in letters, art, and good-fellowship.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;L&rsquo;oiselet retourne aux
for&ecirc;ts;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Je suis un po&euml;te lyrique,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he cries, with a note like a bird&rsquo;s song.&nbsp; Among
the thirty-six every one will have his favourites.&nbsp; We
venture to translate the &ldquo;Ballad de Banville&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;AUX ENFANTS
PERDUS</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know Cythera long is desolate;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I know the winds have stripped the garden green.<br
/>
Alas, my friends! beneath the fierce sun&rsquo;s weight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A barren reef lies where Love&rsquo;s flowers have
been,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor ever lover on that coast is seen!<br />
So be it, for we seek a fabled shore,<br />
To lull our vague desires with mystic lore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To wander where Love&rsquo;s labyrinths, beguile;<br
/>
There let us land, there dream for evermore:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;It may be we shall touch the happy
isle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sea may be our sepulchre.&nbsp; If Fate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If tempests wreak their wrath on us, serene<br />
We watch the bolt of Heaven, and scorn the hate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of angry gods that smite us in their spleen.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Perchance the jealous mists are but the screen<br />
That veils the fairy coast we would explore.<br />
Come, though the sea be vexed, and breakers roar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, for the breath of this old world is vile,<br
/>
Haste we, and toil, and faint not at the oar;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;It may be we shall touch the happy
isle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grey serpents trail in temples desecrate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Cypris smiled, the golden maid, the queen,<br
/>
And ruined is the palace of our state;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But happy loves flit round the mast, and keen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The shrill wind sings the silken cords between.<br
/>
Heroes are we, with wearied hearts and sore,<br />
Whose flower is faded and whose locks are hoar.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Haste, ye light skiffs, where myrtle thickets
smile;<br />
Love&rsquo;s panthers sleep &rsquo;mid roses, as of yore:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;It may be we shall touch the happy
isle.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Envoi</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sad eyes! the blue sea laughs, as heretofore.<br />
All, singing birds, your happy music pour;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, poets, leave the sordid earth awhile;<br />
Flit to these ancient gods we still adore:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;It may be we shall touch the happy
isle.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alas! the mists that veil the shore of our Cythera are not the
summer haze of Watteau, but the smoke and steam of a commercial
time.</p>
<p>It is as a lyric poet that we have studied M. De
Banville.&nbsp; &ldquo;Je ne m&rsquo;entends qu&rsquo;&agrave; la
m&eacute;urique,&rdquo; he says in his ballad on himself; but he
can write prose when he pleases.</p>
<p>It is in his drama of <i>Gringoire</i> acted at the
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais, and familiar in the version
of Messrs. Pollock and Besant, that M. De Banville&rsquo;s prose
shows to the best advantage.&nbsp; Louis XI. is supping with his
bourgeois friends and with the terrible Olivier le Daim.&nbsp;
Two beautiful girls are of the company, friends of Pierre
Gringoire, the strolling poet.&nbsp; Presently Gringoire himself
appears.&nbsp; He is dying of hunger; he does not recognise the
king, and he is promised a good supper if he will recite the new
satirical &ldquo;Ballade des Pendus,&rdquo; which he has made at
the monarch&rsquo;s expense.&nbsp; Hunger overcomes his timidity,
and, addressing himself especially to the king, he enters on this
goodly matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Where wide the forest boughs are spread,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Flora wakes with sylph and fay,<br />
Are crowns and garlands of men dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All golden in the morning gay;<br />
Within this ancient garden grey<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are clusters such as no mail knows,<br />
Where Moor and Soldan bear the sway:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>This is King Louis&rsquo; orchard close</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;These wretched folk wave overhead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With such strange thoughts as none may say;<br />
A moment still, then sudden sped,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They swing in a ring and waste away.<br />
The morning smites them with her ray;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They toss with every breeze that blows,<br />
They dance where fires of dawning play:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>This is King Louis&rsquo; orchard close</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;All hanged and dead, they&rsquo;ve summon&egrave;d<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (With Hell to aid, that hears them pray)<br />
New legions of an army dread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now down the blue sky flames the day;<br />
The dew dies off; the foul array<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of obscene ravens gathers and goes,<br />
With wings that flap and beaks that flay:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>This is King Louis&rsquo; orchard close</i>!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Envoi</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince, where leaves murmur of the May,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A tree of bitter clusters grows;<br />
The bodies of men dead are they!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>This is King Louis&rsquo; orchard close</i>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poor Gringoire has no sooner committed himself, than he is
made to recognise the terrible king.&nbsp; He pleads that, if he
must join the ghastly army of the dead, he ought, at least, to be
allowed to finish his supper.&nbsp; This the king grants, and in
the end, after Gringoire has won the heart of the heroine, he
receives his life and a fair bride with a full dowry.</p>
<p><i>Gringoire</i> is a play very different from M. De
Banville&rsquo;s other dramas, and it is not included in the
pretty volume of &ldquo;Com&eacute;dies&rdquo; which closes the
Lemerre series of his poems.&nbsp; The poet has often declared,
with an iteration which has been parodied by M. Richepin, that
&ldquo;comedy is the child of the ode,&rdquo; and that a drama
without the &ldquo;lyric&rdquo; element is scarcely a drama at
all.&nbsp; While comedy retains either the choral ode in its
strict form, or its representative in the shape of lyric
enthusiasm (<i>le lyrisme</i>), comedy is complete and
living.&nbsp; <i>Gringoire</i>, to our mind, has plenty of lyric
enthusiasm; but M. De Banville seems to be of a different
opinion.&nbsp; His republished &ldquo;Com&eacute;dies&rdquo; are
more remote from experience than <i>Gringoire</i>, his characters
are ideal creatures, familiar types of the stage, like Scapin and
&ldquo;le beau L&eacute;andre,&rdquo; or ethereal persons, or
figures of old mythology, like Diana in <i>Diane au Bois</i>, and
Deidamia in the piece which shows Achilles among women.&nbsp; M.
De Banville&rsquo;s dramas have scarcely prose enough in them to
suit the modern taste.&nbsp; They are masques for the delicate
diversion of an hour, and it is not in the nature of things that
they should rival the success of blatant buffooneries.&nbsp; His
earliest pieces&mdash;<i>Le Feuilleton d&rsquo;Aristophane</i>
(acted at the Od&eacute;on, Dec. 26th, 1852), and <i>Le Cousin du
Roi</i> (Od&eacute;on, April 4th, 1857)&mdash;were written in
collaboration with Philox&egrave;ne Boyer, a generous but
indiscreet patron of singers.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dans les salons de Philox&egrave;ne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nous &eacute;tions quatre-vingt rimeurs,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>M. De Banville wrote, parodying the &ldquo;quatre-vingt
ramuers&rdquo; of Victor Hugo.&nbsp; The memory of M.
Boyer&rsquo;s enthusiasm for poetry and his amiable hospitality
are not unlikely to survive both his compositions and those in
which M. De Banville aided him.&nbsp; The latter poet began to
walk alone as a playwright in <i>Le Beau L&eacute;andre</i>
(Vaudeville, 1856)&mdash;a piece with scarcely more substance
than the French scenes in the old Franco-Italian drama
possess.&nbsp; We are taken into an impossible world of gay
non-morality, where a wicked old bourgeois, Orgon, his daughter
Colombine, a pretty flirt, and her lover L&eacute;andre, a
light-hearted scamp, bustle through their little hour.&nbsp;
L&eacute;andre, who has no notion of being married, says,
&ldquo;Le ciel n&rsquo;est pas plus pur que mes
intentions.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the artless Colombine replies,
&ldquo;Alors marions-nous!&rdquo;&nbsp; To marry Colombine
without a dowry forms, as a modern novelist says, &ldquo;no part
of L&eacute;andre&rsquo;s profligate scheme of
pleasure.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a sort of treble intrigue.&nbsp;
Orgon wants to give away Colombine dowerless, L&eacute;andre to
escape from the whole transaction, and Colombine to secure her
<i>dot</i> and her husband.&nbsp; The strength of the piece is
the brisk action in the scene when L&eacute;andre protests that
he can&rsquo;t rob Orgon of his only daughter, and Orgon insists
that he can refuse nothing except his ducats to so charming a
son-in-law.&nbsp; The play is redeemed from sordidness by the
costumes.&nbsp; L&eacute;andre is dressed in the attire of
Watteau&rsquo;s &ldquo;L&rsquo;Indiff&eacute;rent&rdquo; in the
Louvre, and wears a diamond-hilted sword.&nbsp; The lady who
plays the part of Colombine may select (delightful privilege!)
the prettiest dress in Watteau&rsquo;s collection.</p>
<p>This love of the glitter of the stage is very characteristic
of De Banville.&nbsp; In his <i>D&eacute;idamie</i>
(Od&eacute;on, Nov. 18th, 1876) the players who took the roles of
Thetis, Achilles, Odysseus, Deidamia, and the rest, were
accoutred in semi-barbaric raiment and armour of the period
immediately preceding the Graeco-Phoenician (about the eighth
century B.C.).&nbsp; Again we notice the touch of pedantry in the
poet.&nbsp; As for the play, the sombre thread in it is lent by
the certainty of Achilles&rsquo; early death, the fate which
drives him from D&eacute;idamie&rsquo;s arms, and from the sea
king&rsquo;s isle to the leagues under the fatal walls of
Ilion.&nbsp; Of comic effect there is plenty, for the sisters of
D&eacute;idamie imitate all the acts by which Achilles is likely
to betray himself&mdash;grasp the sword among the insidious
presents of Odysseus, when he seizes the spear, and drink each
one of them a huge beaker of wine to the confusion of the
Trojans. <a name="citation70"></a><a href="#footnote70"
class="citation">[70]</a>&nbsp; On a Parisian audience the
imitations of the tone of the Odyssey must have been thrown
away.&nbsp; For example, here is a passage which is as near being
Homeric as French verse can be.&nbsp; D&eacute;idamie is speaking
in a melancholy mood:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Heureux les &eacute;poux rois assis dans
leur maison,<br />
Qui voient tranquillement s&rsquo;enfuir chaque saison&mdash;<br
/>
L&rsquo;&eacute;poux tenant son sceptre, environn&eacute; de
gloire,<br />
Et l&rsquo;&eacute;pouse filant sa quenouille d&rsquo;ivoire!<br
/>
Mais le jeune h&eacute;ros que, la glaive &agrave; son franc!<br
/>
Court dans le noir combat, les mains teintes de sang,<br />
Laisse sa femme en pleurs dans sa haute demeure.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the accustomed pedantry, M. De Banville, in the scene of
the banquet, makes the cup-bearer go round dealing out a little
wine, with which libation is made, and then the feast goes on in
proper Homeric fashion.&nbsp; These overwrought details are
forgotten in the parting scenes, where D&eacute;idamie takes what
she knows to be her last farewell of Achilles, and girds him with
his sword:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;La lame de l&rsquo;&eacute;p&eacute;e, en
sa forme divine<br />
Est pareille &agrave; la feuille aust&egrave;re du
laurier!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let it be noted that each of M. De Banville&rsquo;s more
serious plays ends with the same scene, with slight
differences.&nbsp; In <i>Florise</i> (never put on the stage) the
wandering actress of Hardy&rsquo;s troupe leaves her lover, the
young noble, and the shelter of his castle, to follow where art
and her genius beckon her.&nbsp; In <i>Diane au Bois</i> the
goddess &ldquo;that leads the precise life&rdquo; turns her back
on Eros, who has subdued even her, and passes from the scene as
she waves her hand in sign of a farewell ineffably
mournful.&nbsp; Nearer tragedy than this M. De Banville does not
care to go; and if there is any deeper tragedy in scenes of blood
and in stages strewn with corpses, from that he abstains.&nbsp;
His <i>Florise</i> is perhaps too long, perhaps too learned; and
certainly we are asked to believe too much when a kind of
etherealised Consuelo is set before us as the <i>prima donna</i>
of old Hardy&rsquo;s troupe:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mais Florise n&rsquo;est pas une
femme.&nbsp; Je suis<br />
L&rsquo;harmonieuse voix que berce vos ennuis;<br />
Je suis la lyre aux sons divers que le po&euml;te<br />
Fait r&eacute;sonner et qui sans lui serait muette&mdash;<br />
Une com&eacute;dienne enfin.&nbsp; Je ne suis pas<br />
Une femme.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An actress who was not a woman had little to do in the company
of Scarron&rsquo;s Ang&eacute;lique and Mademoiselle de
l&rsquo;Estoile.&nbsp; Florise, in short, is somewhat too
allegorical and haughty a creature; while Colombine and
N&eacute;rine (Vaudeville, June 1864) are rather tricksy imps
than women of flesh and blood.&nbsp; M. De Banville&rsquo;s
stage, on the whole, is one of glitter and fantasy; yet he is too
much a Greek for the age that appreciates &ldquo;la belle
H&eacute;l&egrave;ne,&rdquo; too much a lyric dramatist to please
the contemporaries of Sardou; he lends too much sentiment and
dainty refinement to characters as flimsy as those of
Offenbach&rsquo;s drama.</p>
<p>Like other French poets, M. De Banville has occasionally
deigned to write <i>feuilletons</i> and criticisms.&nbsp; Not
many of these scattered leaves are collected, but one volume,
&ldquo;La Mer de Nice&rdquo; (Poulet-Malassis et De Broise,
Paris, 1861), may be read with pleasure even by jealous admirers
of Gautier&rsquo;s success as a chronicler of the impressions
made by southern scenery.</p>
<p>To De Banville (he does not conceal it) a journey to a place
so far from Paris as the Riviera was no slight labour.&nbsp; Even
from the roses, the palms, the siren sea, the wells of water
under the fronds of maiden-hair fern, his mind travels back
wistfully to the city of his love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, I have always been, one of those devotees of
Paris who visit Greece only when they gaze on the face, so fair
and so terrible, of the twice-victorious Venus of the
Louvre.&nbsp; One of those obstinate adorers of my town am I, who
will never see Italy, save in the glass that reflects the tawny
hair of Titian&rsquo;s Violante, or in that dread isle of
Alcinous where Lionardo shows you the mountain peaks that waver
in the blue behind the mysterious Monna Lisa.&nbsp; But the
Faculty of Physicians, which has, I own, the right to be
sceptical, does not believe that neuralgia can be healed by the
high sun which Titian and Veronese have fixed on the
canvas.&nbsp; To me the Faculty prescribes the real sun of nature
and of life; and here am I, condemned to learn in suffering all
that passes in the mind of a poet of Paris exiled from that
blessed place where he finds the Cyclades and the islands
blossoming, the vale of Avalon, and all the heavenly homes of the
fairies of experience and desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nice is Tomi to this Ovid, but he makes the best of it, and
sends to the editor of the <i>Moniteur</i> letters much more
diverting than the &ldquo;Tristia.&rdquo;&nbsp; To tell the
truth, he never overcomes his amazement at being out of Paris
streets, and in a glade of the lower Alps he loves to be reminded
of his dear city of pleasure.&nbsp; Only under the olives of
Monaco, those solemn and ancient trees, he feels what surely all
men feel who walk at sunset through their shadow&mdash;the memory
of a mysterious twilight of agony in an olive garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Et ceux-ci, les p&acirc;les oliviers, n&rsquo;est-ce
pas de ces heures d&eacute;sol&eacute;es o&ugrave;, comme torture
supr&ecirc;me, le Sauveur acceptait en son &acirc;me
l&rsquo;irr&ecirc;parable mis&egrave;re du doute, n&rsquo;est-ce
pas alors qu&rsquo;il ont appris de lui &agrave; courber le front
sous le poids imp&eacute;rieux des souvenirs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pages which M. De Banville consecrates to the Villa
Sardou, where Rachel died, may disenchant, perhaps, some readers
of Mr. Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s sonnet.&nbsp; The scene of
Rachel&rsquo;s death has been spoiled by
&ldquo;improvements&rdquo; in too theatrical taste.&nbsp; All
these notes, however, were made many years ago; and visitors of
the Riviera, though they will find the little book charming where
it speaks of seas and hills, will learn that France has greatly
changed the city which she has annexed.&nbsp; As a practical man
and a Parisian, De Banville has printed (pp. 179-81) a recipe for
the concoction of the Marseilles dish, <i>bouillabaisse</i>, the
mess that Thackeray&rsquo;s ballad made so famous.&nbsp; It takes
genius, however, to cook <i>bouillabaisse</i>; and, to parody
what De Banville says about his own recipe for making a
mechanical &ldquo;ballade,&rdquo; &ldquo;en employment ce moyen,
on est s&ucirc;r de faire une mauvaise,
irr&eacute;m&eacute;diablement mauvaise
<i>bouillabaisse</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poet adds the remark that
&ldquo;une bouillabaisse r&eacute;ussie vaut un sonnet sans
d&eacute;faut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There remains one field of M. De Banville&rsquo;s activity to
be shortly described.&nbsp; Of his &ldquo;Emaux Parisiens,&rdquo;
short studies of celebrated writers, we need say no more than
that they are written in careful prose.&nbsp; M. De Banville is
not only a poet, but in his &ldquo;Petit Trait&eacute; de
Po&eacute;sie Fran&ccedil;aise&rdquo; (Biblioth&egrave;que de
l&rsquo;Echo de la Sorbonne, s.d.) a teacher of the mechanical
part of poetry.&nbsp; He does not, of course, advance a paradox
like that of Baudelaire, &ldquo;that poetry can be taught in
thirty lessons.&rdquo;&nbsp; He merely instructs his pupil in the
material part&mdash;the scansion, metres, and so on&mdash;of
French poetry.&nbsp; In this little work he introduces these
&ldquo;traditional forms of verse,&rdquo; which once caused some
talk in England: the <i>rondel</i>, <i>rondeau</i>,
<i>ballade,</i> <i>villanelle</i>, and <i>chant royal</i>.&nbsp;
It may be worth while to quote his testimony as to the merit of
these modes of expression.&nbsp; &ldquo;This cluster of forms is
one of our most precious treasures, for each of them forms a
rhythmic whole, complete and perfect, while at the same time they
all possess the fresh and unconscious grace which marks the
productions of primitive times.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, there is some
truth in this criticism; for it is a mark of man&rsquo;s early
ingenuity, in many arts, to seek complexity (where you would
expect simplicity), and yet to lend to that complexity an
infantine naturalness.&nbsp; One can see this phenomenon in early
decorative art, and in early law and custom, and even in the
complicated structure of primitive languages.&nbsp; Now, just as
early, and even savage, races are our masters in the decorative
use of colour and of carving, so the nameless master-singers of
ancient France may be our teachers in decorative poetry, the
poetry some call <i>vers de soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i>.&nbsp;
Whether it is possible to go beyond this, and adapt the old
French forms to serious modern poetry, it is not for any one but
time to decide.&nbsp; In this matter, as in greater affairs,
<i>securus judicat orbis terrarum</i>.&nbsp; For my own part I
scarcely believe that the revival would serve the nobler ends of
English poetry.&nbsp; Now let us listen again to De Banville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the <i>rondel</i>, as in the <i>rondeau</i> and the
<i>ballade</i>, all the art is to bring in the refrain without
effort, naturally, gaily, and each time with novel effect and
with fresh light cast on the central idea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, you
can <i>teach</i> no one to do that, and M. De Banville never
pretends to give any recipes for cooking <i>rondels</i> or
<i>ballades</i> worth reading.&nbsp; &ldquo;Without poetic
<i>vision</i> all is mere marquetery and cabinet-maker&rsquo;s
work: that is, so far as poetry is
concerned&mdash;nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is because he was a
poet, not a mere craftsman, that Villon was and remains the king,
the absolute master, of ballad-land.&rdquo;&nbsp; About the
<i>rondeau</i>, M. De Banville avers that it possesses
&ldquo;nimble movement, speed, grace, lightness of touch, and, as
it were, an ancient fragrance of the soil, that must charm all
who love our country and our country&rsquo;s poetry, in its every
age.&rdquo;&nbsp; As for the <i>villanelle</i>, M. De Banville
declares that it is the fairest jewel in the casket of the muse
Erato; while the <i>chant royal</i> is a kind of fossil poem, a
relic of an age when kings and allegories flourished.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The kings and the gods are dead,&rdquo; like Pan; or at
least we no longer find them able, by touch royal or divine, to
reanimate the magnificent <i>chant royal</i>.</p>
<p>This is M. De Banville&rsquo;s apology in <i>pro lyr&acirc;
su&acirc;</i>, that light lyre of many tones, in whose jingle the
eternal note of modern sadness is heard so rarely.&nbsp; If he
has a lesson to teach English versifiers, surely it is a lesson
of gaiety.&nbsp; They are only too fond of rue and rosemary, and
now and then prefer the cypress to the bay.&nbsp; M. De
Banville&rsquo;s muse is content to wear roses in her locks, and
perhaps may retain, for many years, a laurel leaf from the
ancient laurel tree which once sheltered the poet at Turbia.</p>
<h2>HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK</h2>
<p>The Greek language is being ousted from education, here, in
France, and in America.&nbsp; The speech of the earliest
democracies is not democratic enough for modern anarchy.&nbsp;
There is nothing to be gained, it is said, by a knowledge of
Greek.&nbsp; We have not to fight the battle of life with
Hellenic waiters; and, even if we had, Romaic, or modern Greek,
is much more easily learned than the old classical tongue.&nbsp;
The reason of this comparative ease will be plain to any one who,
retaining a vague memory of his Greek grammar, takes up a modern
Greek newspaper.&nbsp; He will find that the idioms of the modern
newspaper are the idioms of all newspapers, that the grammar is
the grammar of modern languages, that the opinions are expressed
in barbarous translations of barbarous French and English
journalistic <i>clich&eacute;s</i> or commonplaces.&nbsp; This
ugly and undignified mixture of the ancient Greek characters, and
of ancient Greek words with modern grammar and idioms, and
stereotyped phrases, is extremely distasteful to the
scholar.&nbsp; Modern Greek, as it is at present printed, is not
the natural spoken language of the peasants.&nbsp; You can read a
Greek leading article, though you can hardly make sense of a
Greek rural ballad.&nbsp; The peasant speech is a thing of slow
development; there is a basis of ancient Greek in it, with large
elements of Slavonic, Turkish, Italian, and other imposed or
imported languages.&nbsp; Modern literary Greek is a hybrid of
revived classical words, blended with the idioms of the speeches
which have arisen since the fall of the Roman Empire.&nbsp; Thus,
thanks to the modern and familiar element in it, modern Greek
&ldquo;as she is writ&rdquo; is much more easily learned than
ancient Greek.&nbsp; Consequently, if any one has need for the
speech in business or travel, he can acquire as much of it as
most of us have of French, with considerable ease.&nbsp; People
therefore argue that ancient Greek is particularly superfluous in
schools.&nbsp; Why waste time on it, they ask, which could be
expended on science, on modern languages, or any other branch of
education?&nbsp; There is a great deal of justice in this
position.&nbsp; The generation of men who are now middle-aged
bestowed much time and labour on Greek; and in what, it may be
asked, are they better for it?&nbsp; Very few of them &ldquo;keep
up their Greek.&rdquo;&nbsp; Say, for example, that one was in a
form with fifty boys who began the study&mdash;it is odds against
five of the survivors still reading Greek books.&nbsp; The
worldly advantages of the study are slight: it may lead three of
the fifty to a good degree, and one to a fellowship; but good
degrees may be taken in other subjects, and fellowships may be
abolished, or &ldquo;nationalised,&rdquo; with all other forms of
property.</p>
<p>Then, why maintain Greek in schools?&nbsp; Only a very minute
percentage of the boys who are tormented with it really learn
it.&nbsp; Only a still smaller percentage can read it after they
are thirty.&nbsp; Only one or two gain any material advantage by
it.&nbsp; In very truth, most minds are not framed by nature to
excel and to delight in literature, and only to such minds and to
schoolmasters is Greek valuable.</p>
<p>This is the case against Greek put as powerfully as one can
state it.&nbsp; On the other side, we may say, though the remark
may seem absurd at first sight, that to have mastered Greek, even
if you forget it, is not to have wasted time.&nbsp; It really is
an educational and mental discipline.&nbsp; The study is so
severe that it needs the earnest application of the mind.&nbsp;
The study is averse to indolent intellectual ways; it will not
put up with a &ldquo;there or thereabouts,&rdquo; any more than
mathematical ideas admit of being made to seem &ldquo;extremely
plausible.&rdquo;&nbsp; He who writes, and who may venture to
offer himself as an example, is naturally of a most slovenly and
slatternly mental habit.&nbsp; It is his constant temptation to
&ldquo;scamp&rdquo; every kind of work, and to say &ldquo;it will
do well enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; He hates taking trouble and
verifying references.&nbsp; And he can honestly confess that
nothing in his experience has so helped, in a certain degree, to
counteract those tendencies&mdash;as the labour of thoroughly
learning certain Greek texts&mdash;the dramatists, Thucydides,
some of the books of Aristotle.&nbsp; Experience has satisfied
him that Greek is of real educational value, and, apart from the
acknowledged and unsurpassed merit of its literature, is a severe
and logical training of the mind.&nbsp; The mental constitution
is strengthened and braced by the labour, even if the language is
forgotten in later life.</p>
<p>It is manifest, however, that this part of education is not
for everybody.&nbsp; The real educational problem is to discover
what boys Greek will be good for, and what boys will only waste
time and dawdle over it.&nbsp; Certainly to men of a literary
turn (a very minute percentage), Greek is of an inestimable
value.&nbsp; Great poets, even, may be ignorant of it, as
Shakespeare probably was, as Keats and Scott certainly were, as
Alexandre Dumas was.&nbsp; But Dumas regretted his ignorance;
Scott regretted it.&nbsp; We know not how much Scott&rsquo;s
admitted laxity of style and hurried careless habit might have
been modified by a knowledge of Greek; how much of grace,
permanence, and generally of art, his genius might have gained
from the language and literature of Hellas.&nbsp; The most
Homeric of modern men could not read Homer.&nbsp; As for Keats,
he was born a Greek, it has been said; but had he been born with
a knowledge of Greek, he never, probably, would have been guilty
of his chief literary faults.&nbsp; This is not certain, for some
modern men of letters deeply read in Greek have all the qualities
of fustian and effusiveness which Longinus most despised.&nbsp;
Greek will not make a luxuriously Asiatic mind Hellenic, it is
certain; but it may, at least, help to restrain effusive and
rhetorical gabble.&nbsp; Our Asiatic rhetoricians might perhaps
be even more barbarous than they are if Greek were a sealed book
to them.&nbsp; However this may be, it is, at least, well to find
out in a school what boys are worth instructing in the Greek
language.&nbsp; Now, of their worthiness, of their chances of
success in the study, Homer seems the best touchstone; and he is
certainly the most attractive guide to the study.</p>
<p>At present boys are introduced to the language of the Muses by
pedantically written grammars, full of the queerest and most arid
metaphysical and philological verbiage.&nbsp; The very English in
which these deplorable books are composed may be scientific, may
be comprehensible by and useful to philologists, but is utterly
heart-breaking to boys.</p>
<p>Philology might be made fascinating; the history of a word,
and of the processes by which its different forms, in different
senses, were developed, might be made as interesting as any other
story of events.&nbsp; But grammar is not taught thus: boys are
introduced to a jargon about matters meaningless, and they are
naturally as much enchanted as if they were listening to a
<i>chim&aelig;ra bombinans in vacuo</i>.&nbsp; The grammar, to
them, is a mere buzz in a chaos of nonsense.&nbsp; They have to
learn the buzz by rote; and a pleasant process that is&mdash;a
seductive initiation into the mysteries.&nbsp; When they struggle
so far as to be allowed to try to read a piece of Greek prose,
they are only like the Marchioness in her experience of beer: she
once had a sip of it.&nbsp; Ten lines of Xenophon, narrating how
he marched so many parasangs and took breakfast, do not amount to
more than a very unrefreshing sip of Greek.&nbsp; Nobody even
tells the boys who Xenophon was, what he did there, and what it
was all about.&nbsp; Nobody gives a brief and interesting sketch
of the great march, of its history and objects.&nbsp; The boys
straggle along with Xenophon, knowing not whence or whither:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They stray through a desolate region,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And often are faint on the march.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One by one they fall out of the ranks; they mutiny against
Xenophon; they murmur against that commander; they desert his
flag.&nbsp; They determine that anything is better than Greek,
that nothing can be worse than Greek, and they move the tender
hearts of their parents.&nbsp; They are put to learn German;
which they do not learn, unluckily, but which they find it
comparatively easy to shirk.&nbsp; In brief, they leave school
without having learned anything whatever.</p>
<p>Up to a certain age my experiences at school were precisely
those which I have described.&nbsp; Our grammar was not so
philological, abstruse and arid as the instruments of torture
employed at present.&nbsp; But I hated Greek with a deadly and
sickening hatred; I hated it like a bully and a thief of
time.&nbsp; The verbs in &mu;&upsilon; completed my intellectual
discomfiture, and Xenophon routed me with horrible carnage.&nbsp;
I could have run away to sea, but for a strong impression that a
life on the ocean wave &ldquo;did not set my genius,&rdquo; as
Alan Breck says.&nbsp; Then we began to read Homer; and from the
very first words, in which the Muse is asked to sing the wrath of
Achilles, Peleus&rsquo; son, my mind was altered, and I was the
devoted friend of Greek.&nbsp; Here was something worth reading
about; here one knew where one was; here was the music of words,
here were poetry, pleasure, and life.&nbsp; We fortunately had a
teacher (Dr. Hodson) who was not wildly enthusiastic about
grammar.&nbsp; He would set us long pieces of the Iliad or
Odyssey to learn, and, when the day&rsquo;s task was done, would
make us read on, adventuring ourselves in &ldquo;the
unseen,&rdquo; and construing as gallantly as we might, without
grammar or dictionary.&nbsp; On the following day we surveyed
more carefully the ground we had pioneered or skirmished over,
and then advanced again.&nbsp; Thus, to change the metaphor, we
took Homer in large draughts, not in sips: in sips no epic can be
enjoyed.&nbsp; We now revelled in Homer like Keats in Spenser,
like young horses let loose in a pasture.&nbsp; The result was
not the making of many accurate scholars, though a few were made;
others got nothing better than enjoyment in their work, and the
firm belief, opposed to that of most schoolboys, that the
ancients did not write nonsense.&nbsp; To love Homer, as Steele
said about loving a fair lady of quality, &ldquo;is a liberal
education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judging from this example, I venture very humbly to think that
any one who, even at the age of Cato, wants to learn Greek,
should begin where Greek literature, where all profane literature
begins&mdash;with Homer himself.&nbsp; It was thus, not with
grammars <i>in vacuo</i>, that the great scholars of the
Renaissance began.&nbsp; It was thus that Ascham and Rabelais
began, by jumping into Greek and splashing about till they
learned to swim.&nbsp; First, of course, a person must learn the
Greek characters.&nbsp; Then his or her tutor may make him read a
dozen lines of Homer, marking the cadence, the surge and thunder
of the hexameters&mdash;a music which, like that of the Sirens,
few can hear without being lured to the seas and isles of
song.&nbsp; Then the tutor might translate a passage of moving
interest, like Priam&rsquo;s appeal to Achilles; first, of
course, explaining the situation.&nbsp; Then the teacher might go
over some lines, minutely pointing out how the Greek words are
etymologically connected with many words in English.&nbsp; Next,
he might take a substantive and a verb, showing roughly how their
inflections arose and were developed, and how they retain forms
in Homer which do not occur in later Greek.&nbsp; There is no
reason why even this part of the lesson should be
uninteresting.&nbsp; By this time a pupil would know, more or
less, where he was, what Greek is, and what the Homeric poems are
like.&nbsp; He might thus believe from the first that there are
good reasons for knowing Greek; that it is the key to many worlds
of life, of action, of beauty, of contemplation, of
knowledge.&nbsp; Then, after a few more exercises in Homer, the
grammar being judiciously worked in along with the literature of
the epic, a teacher might discern whether it was worth while for
his pupils to continue in the study of Greek.&nbsp; Homer would
be their guide into the &ldquo;realms of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is clear enough that Homer is the best guide.&nbsp; His is
the oldest extant Greek, his matter is the most various and
delightful, and most appeals to the young, who are wearied by
scraps of Xenophon, and who cannot be expected to understand the
Tragedians.&nbsp; But Homer is a poet for all ages, all races,
and all moods.&nbsp; To the Greeks the epics were not only the
best of romances, the richest of poetry; not only their oldest
documents about their own history,&mdash;they were also their
Bible, their treasury of religious traditions and moral
teaching.&nbsp; With the Bible and Shakespeare, the Homeric poems
are the best training for life.&nbsp; There is no good quality
that they lack: manliness, courage, reverence for old age and for
the hospitable hearth; justice, piety, pity, a brave attitude
towards life and death, are all conspicuous in Homer.&nbsp; He
has to write of battles; and he delights in the joy of battle,
and in all the movement of war.&nbsp; Yet he delights not less,
but more, in peace: in prosperous cities, hearths secure, in the
tender beauty of children, in the love of wedded wives, in the
frank nobility of maidens, in the beauty of earth and sky and
sea, and seaward murmuring river, in sun and snow, frost and mist
and rain, in the whispered talk of boy and girl beneath oak and
pine tree.</p>
<p>Living in an age where every man was a warrior, where every
city might know the worst of sack and fire, where the noblest
ladies might be led away for slaves, to light the fire and make
the bed of a foreign master, Homer inevitably regards life as a
battle.&nbsp; To each man on earth comes &ldquo;the wicked day of
destiny,&rdquo; as Malory unconsciously translates it, and each
man must face it as hardily as he may.</p>
<p>Homer encourages them by all the maxims of chivalry and
honour.&nbsp; His heart is with the brave of either
side&mdash;with Glaucus and Sarpedon of Lycia no less than with
Achilles and Patroclus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, friend,&rdquo; cries
Sarpedon, &ldquo;if once escaped from this battle we were for
ever to be ageless and immortal, neither would I myself fight now
in the foremost ranks, nor would I urge thee into the wars that
give renown; but now&mdash;for assuredly ten thousand fates of
death on every side beset us, and these may no man shun, nor none
avoid&mdash;forward now let us go, whether we are to give glory
or to win it!&rdquo;&nbsp; And forth they go, to give and take
renown and death, all the shields and helms of Lycia shining
behind them, through the dust of battle, the singing of the
arrows, the hurtling of spears, the rain of stones from the
Locrian slings.&nbsp; And shields are smitten, and chariot-horses
run wild with no man to drive them, and Sarpedon drags down a
portion of the Ach&aelig;an battlement, and Aias leaps into the
trench with his deadly spear, and the whole battle shifts and
shines beneath the sun.&nbsp; Yet he who sings of the war, and
sees it with his sightless eyes, sees also the Trojan women
working at the loom, cheating their anxious hearts with broidery
work of gold and scarlet, or raising the song to Athene, or
heating the bath for Hector, who never again may pass within the
gates of Troy.&nbsp; He sees the poor weaving woman, weighing the
wool, that she may not defraud her employers, and yet may win
bread for her children.&nbsp; He sees the children, the golden
head of Astyanax, his shrinking from the splendour of the
hero&rsquo;s helm.&nbsp; He sees the child Odysseus, going with
his father through the orchard, and choosing out some apple trees
&ldquo;for his very own.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is in the mouth of the
ruthless Achilles, the fatal, the fated, the swift-footed hero
with the hands of death, that Homer places the tenderest of his
similes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherefore weepest thou, Patroclus, like a
fond little maid, that runs by her mother&rsquo;s side, praying
her mother to take her up, snatching at her gown, and hindering
her as she walks, and tearfully looking at her till her mother
takes her up?&mdash;like her, Patroclus, dost thou softly
weep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is what Chesterfield calls &ldquo;the porter-like
language of Homer&rsquo;s heroes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such are the moods
of Homer, so full of love of life and all things living, so rich
in all human sympathies, so readily moved when the great hound
Argus welcomes his master, whom none knew after twenty years, but
the hound knew him, and died in that welcome.&nbsp; With all this
love of the real, which makes him dwell so fondly on every detail
of armour, of implement, of art; on the divers-coloured gold-work
of the shield, on the making of tires for chariot-wheels, on the
forging of iron, on the rose-tinted ivory of the Sidonians, on
cooking and eating and sacrificing, on pet dogs, on wasps and
their ways, on fishing, on the boar hunt, on scenes in baths
where fair maidens lave water over the heroes, on undiscovered
isles with good harbours and rich land, on ploughing, mowing, and
sowing, on the furniture of houses, on the golden vases wherein
the white dust of the dead is laid,&mdash;with all this delight
in the real, Homer is the most romantic of poets.&nbsp; He walks
with the surest foot in the darkling realm of dread Persephone,
beneath the poplars on the solemn last beach of Ocean.&nbsp; He
has heard the Siren&rsquo;s music, and the song of Circe,
chanting as she walks to and fro, casting the golden shuttle
through the loom of gold.&nbsp; He enters the cave of the Man
Eater; he knows the unsunned land of the Cimmerians; in the
summer of the North he has looked, from the fiord of the
Laestrygons, on the Midnight Sun.&nbsp; He has dwelt on the
floating isle of &AElig;olus, with its wall of bronze unbroken,
and has sailed on those Ph&aelig;acian barks that need no help of
helm or oar, that fear no stress either of wind or tide, that
come and go and return obedient to a thought and silent as a
dream.&nbsp; He has seen the four maidens of Circe, daughters of
wells and woods, and of sacred streams.&nbsp; He is the
second-sighted man, and beholds the shroud that wraps the living
who are doomed, and the mystic dripping from the walls of blood
yet unshed.&nbsp; He has walked in the garden closes of
Ph&aelig;acia, and looked on the face of gods who fare thither,
and watch the weaving of the dance.&nbsp; He has eaten the
honey-sweet fruit of the lotus, and from the hand of Helen he
brings us that Egyptian nepenthe which puts all sorrow out of
mind.&nbsp; His real world is as real as that in <i>Henry V.</i>,
his enchanted isles are charmed with the magic of the
<i>Tempest</i>.&nbsp; His young wooers are as insolent as
Claudio, as flushed with youth; his beggar-men are brethren of
Edie Ochiltree; his Nausicaa is sister to Rosalind, with a
different charm of stately purity in love.&nbsp; His
enchantresses hold us yet with their sorceries; his Helen is very
Beauty: she has all the sweetness of ideal womanhood, and her
repentance is without remorse.&nbsp; His Achilles is youth
itself, glorious, cruel, pitiful, splendid, and sad, ardent and
loving, and conscious of its doom.&nbsp; Homer, in truth, is to
be matched only with Shakespeare, and of Shakespeare he has not
the occasional wilfulness, freakishness, and modish
obscurity.&nbsp; He is a poet all of gold, universal as humanity,
simple as childhood, musical now as the flow of his own rivers,
now as the heavy plunging wave of his own Ocean.</p>
<p>Such, then, as far as weak words can speak of him, is the
first and greatest of poets.&nbsp; This is he whom English boys
are to be ignorant of, if Greek be ousted from our schools, or
are to know only in the distorting mirror of a versified, or in
the pale shadow of a prose translation.&nbsp; Translations are
good only as teachers to bring men to Homer.&nbsp; English verse
has no measure which even remotely suggests the various flow of
the hexameter.&nbsp; Translators who employ verse give us a
feeble Homer, dashed with their own conceits, and moulded to
their own style.&nbsp; Translators who employ prose &ldquo;tell
the story without the song,&rdquo; but, at least, they add no
twopenny &ldquo;beauties&rdquo; and cheap conceits of their
own.</p>
<p>I venture to offer a few examples of original translation, in
which the mannerisms of poets who have, or have not, translated
Homer, are parodied, and, of course (except in the case of Pope),
exaggerated.&nbsp; The passage is the speech of the
Second-sighted Man, before the slaying of the wooers in the
hall:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ah! wretched men, what ill is this ye
suffer?&nbsp; In night are swathed your heads, your faces, your
knees; and the voice of wailing is kindled, and cheeks are wet
with tears, and with blood drip the walls, and the fair main
beams of the roof, and the porch is full of shadows, and full is
the courtyard, of ghosts that hasten hellward below the darkness,
and the sun has perished out of heaven, and an evil mist sweeps
up over all.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So much for Homer.&nbsp; The first attempt at metric
translation here given is meant to be in the manner of Pope:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Caitiffs!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what
heaven-directed blight<br />
Involves each countenance with clouds of night!<br />
What pearly drop the ashen cheek bedews!<br />
Why do the walls with gouts ensanguined ooze?<br />
The court is thronged with ghosts that &rsquo;neath the gloom<br
/>
Seek Pluto&rsquo;s realm, and Dis&rsquo;s awful doom;<br />
In ebon curtains Phoebus hides his head,<br />
And sable mist creeps upward from the dead.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This appears pretty bad, and nearly as un-Homeric as a
translation could possibly be.&nbsp; But Pope, aided by Broome
and Fenton, managed to be much less Homeric, much more absurd,
and infinitely more &ldquo;classical&rdquo; in the sense in which
Pope is classical:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O race to death devote! with Stygian
shade<br />
Each destined peer impending fates invade;<br />
With tears your wan distorted cheeks are drowned;<br />
With sanguine drops the walls are rubied round:<br />
Thick swarms the spacious hall with howling ghosts,<br />
To people Orcus and the burning coasts!<br />
Nor gives the sun his golden orb to roll,<br />
But universal night usurps the pole.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who could have conjectured that even Pope would wander away so
far from his matchless original?&nbsp; &ldquo;Wretches!&rdquo;
cries Theoclymenus, the seer; and that becomes, &ldquo;O race to
death devote!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Your heads are swathed in
night,&rdquo; turns into &ldquo;With Stygian shade each destined
peer&rdquo; (peer is good!) &ldquo;impending fates invade,&rdquo;
where Homer says nothing about Styx nor peers.&nbsp; The Latin
Orcus takes the place of Erebus, and &ldquo;the burning
coasts&rdquo; are derived from modern popular theology.&nbsp; The
very grammar detains or defies the reader; is it the sun that
does not give his golden orb to roll, or who, or what?</p>
<p>The only place where the latter-day Broome or Fenton can
flatter himself that he rivals Pope at his own game is&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What pearly drop the ashen cheek
bedews!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is, if possible, <i>more</i> classical than Pope&rsquo;s
own&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With tears your wan distorted cheeks are
drowned.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Pope nobly revindicates his unparalleled power of
translating funnily, when, in place of &ldquo;the walls drip with
blood,&rdquo; he writes&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With sanguine drops the walls are rubied
round.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Homer does not appear to have been acquainted with rubies; but
what of that?&nbsp; And how noble, how eminently worthy of Pope
it is to add that the ghosts &ldquo;howl&rdquo;!&nbsp; I tried to
make them gibber, but ghosts <i>do</i> gibber in Homer (though
not in this passage), so Pope, Fenton, Broome, and Co., make them
howl.</p>
<p>No, Pope is not lightly to be rivalled by a modern
translator.&nbsp; The following example, a far-off following of a
noted contemporary poet, may be left unsigned&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Wretches, the bane hath befallen, the night
and the blight of your sin<br />
Sweeps like a shroud o&rsquo;er the faces and limbs that were
gladsome therein;<br />
And the dirge of the dead breaketh forth, and the faces of all
men are wet,<br />
And the walls are besprinkled with blood, and the ghosts in the
gateway are met,<br />
Ghosts in the court and the gateway are gathered, Hell opens her
lips,<br />
And the sun in his splendour is shrouded, and sickens in spasm of
eclipse.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next is longer and slower: the poet has a difficulty in
telling his story:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Wretches,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what doom
is this? what night<br />
Clings like a face-cloth to the face of each,&mdash;<br />
Sweeps like a shroud o&rsquo;er knees and head? for lo!<br />
The windy wail of death is up, and tears<br />
On every cheek are wet; each shining wall<br />
And beauteous interspace of beam and beam<br />
Weeps tears of blood, and shadows in the door<br />
Flicker, and fill the portals and the court&mdash;<br />
Shadows of men that hellwards yearn&mdash;and now<br />
The sun himself hath perished out of heaven,<br />
And all the land is darkened with a mist.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That could never be mistaken for a version by the Laureate, as
perhaps any contemporary hack&rsquo;s works might have been taken
for Pope&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The difficulty, perhaps, lies here: any
one knows where to have Pope, any one knows that he will evade
the <i>mot propre</i>, though the precise evasion he may select
is hard to guess.&nbsp; But the Laureate would keep close to his
text, and yet would write like himself, very beautifully, but not
with an Homeric swiftness and strength.&nbsp; Who is to imitate
him?&nbsp; As to Mr. William Morris, he might be fabled to render
&Alpha; &delta;&epsilon;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&#943;
&ldquo;niddering wights,&rdquo; but beyond that, conjecture is
baffled. <a name="citation91"></a><a href="#footnote91"
class="citation">[91]</a>&nbsp; Or is <i>this</i> the kind of
thing?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Niddering wights, what a bane do ye bear,
for your knees in the night,<br />
And your heads and your faces, are shrouded, and clamour that
knows not delight<br />
Rings, and your cheeks are begrutten, and blood is besprent on
the walls,<br />
Blood on the tapestry fair woven, and barrow-wights walk in the
halls.<br />
Fetches and wraiths of the chosen of the Norns, and the sun from
the lift<br />
Shudders, and over the midgarth and swan&rsquo;s bath the
cloud-shadows drift.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be argued that, though this is perhaps a translation,
it is not English, never was, and never will be.&nbsp; But it is
quite as like Homer as the performance of Pope.</p>
<p>Such as these, or not so very much better than these as might
be wished, are our efforts to translate Homer.&nbsp; From Chapman
to Avia, or Mr. William Morris, they are all eminently
conscientious, and erroneous, and futile.&nbsp; Chapman makes
Homer a fanciful, euphuistic, obscure, and garrulous Elizabethan,
but Chapman has fire.&nbsp; Pope makes him a wit, spirited,
occasionally noble, full of points, and epigrams, and queer
rococo conventionalisms.&nbsp; Cowper makes him slow, lumbering,
a Milton without the music.&nbsp; Maginn makes him pipe an Irish
jig:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Scarcely had she begun to wash<br />
When she was aware of the grisly gash!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lord Derby makes him respectable and ponderous.&nbsp; Lord
Tennyson makes him not less, but certainly not more, than
Tennysonian.&nbsp; Homer, in the Laureate&rsquo;s few fragments
of experiment, is still a poet, but he is not Homer.&nbsp; Mr.
Morris, and Avia, make him Icelandic, and archaistic, and hard to
scan, though vigorous in his fetters for all that.&nbsp; Bohn
makes him a crib; and of other translators in prose it has been
said, with a humour which one of them appreciates, that they
render Homer into a likeness of the Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>Homer is untranslatable.&nbsp; None of us can bend the bow of
Eurytus, and make the bow-string &ldquo;ring sweetly at the
touch, like the swallow&rsquo;s song.&rdquo;&nbsp; The adventure
is never to be achieved; and, if Greek is to be dismissed from
education, not the least of the sorrows that will ensue is
English ignorance of Homer.</p>
<h2>THE LAST FASHIONABLE NOVEL</h2>
<p>The editor of a great American newspaper once offered the
author of these lines a commission to explore a lost country, the
seat of a fallen and forgotten civilisation.&nbsp; It was not in
Yucatan, or Central Africa, or Thibet, or Kafiristan, this
desolate region, once so popular, so gaudy, so much frequented
and desired.&nbsp; It was only the fashionable novels of the
Forties, say from 1835 to 1850, that I was requested to examine
and report upon.&nbsp; But I shrank from the colossal task.&nbsp;
I am no Mr. Stanley; and the length, the difficulties, the
arduousness of the labour appalled me.&nbsp; Besides, I do not
know where that land lies, the land of the old Fashionable Novel,
the K&ocirc;r of which Thackeray&rsquo;s Lady Fanny Flummery is
the Ayesha.&nbsp; What were the names of the old novels, and who
were the authors, and in the circulating library of what
undiscoverable watering-place are they to be found?&nbsp; We have
heard of Mrs. Gore, we have heard of <i>Tremayne</i>, <i>and
Emilia Wyndham</i>, and the <i>Bachelor of the Albany</i>; and
many of us have read <i>Pelham</i>, or know him out of
Carlyle&rsquo;s art, and those great curses which he spoke.&nbsp;
But who was the original, or who were the originals, that sat for
the portrait of the &ldquo;Fashionable Authoress,&rdquo; Lady
Fanny Flummery? and of what work is <i>Lords and Liveries</i> a
parody?&nbsp; The author is also credited with <i>Dukes and
Deje&ucirc;ners</i>, <i>Marchionesses and Milliners</i>,
etc.&nbsp; Could, any candidate in a literary examination name
the prototypes?&nbsp; &ldquo;Let mantua-makers puff her, but not
men,&rdquo; says Thackeray, speaking of Lady Fanny Flummery,
&ldquo;and the Fashionable Authoress is no more.&nbsp; Blessed,
blessed thought!&nbsp; No more fiddle-faddle novels!&nbsp; When
will you arrive, O happy Golden Age!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, it has arrived, though we are none the happier for all
that.&nbsp; The Fashionable Novel has ceased to exist, and the
place of the fashionable authoress knows her no more.&nbsp;
Thackeray plainly detested Lady Fanny.&nbsp; He writes about her,
her books, her critics, her successes, with a certain
bitterness.&nbsp; Can it be possible that a world which rather
neglected <i>Barry Lyndon</i> was devoted to <i>Marchionesses and
Milliners</i>?&nbsp; Lady Fanny is represented as having editors
and reviewers at her feet; she sits among the flowers, like the
Sirens, and around her are the bones of critics corrupt in
death.&nbsp; She is puffed for the sake of her bouquets, her
dinners, her affabilities and condescensions.&nbsp; She gives a
reviewer a great garnet pin, adorned wherewith he paces the
town.&nbsp; Her adorers compare her to &ldquo;him who sleeps by
Avon.&rdquo;&nbsp; In one of Mr. Black&rsquo;s novels there is a
lady of this kind, who captivates the tribe of &ldquo;Log
Rollers,&rdquo; as Mr. Black calls them.&nbsp; This lady appears
to myself to be a quite impossible She.&nbsp; One has never met
her with her wiles, nor come across her track, even, and seen the
bodies and the bones of those who perished in puffing her.&nbsp;
Some persons of rank and fashion have a taste for the society of
some men of letters, but nothing in the way of literary puffery
seems to come of it.&nbsp; Of course many critics like to give
their friends and acquaintances an applausive hand, and among
their acquaintances may be ladies of fashion who write novels;
but we read nowhere such extraordinary adulations as Augustus
Timson bestowed on Lady Fanny.&nbsp; The fashionable authoress is
nearly extinct, though some persons write well albeit they are
fashionable.&nbsp; The fashionable novel is as dead as a door
nail: <i>Lothair</i> was nearly the last of the species.&nbsp;
There are novelists who write about &ldquo;Society,&rdquo; to be
sure, like Mr. Norris; but their tone is quite different.&nbsp;
They do not speak as if Dukes and Earls were some strange
superior kind of beings; their manner is that of men accustomed
to and undazzled by Earls, writing for readers who do not care
whether the hero is a lord or a commoner.&nbsp; They are
&ldquo;at ease,&rdquo; though not terribly &ldquo;in
Zion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thackeray himself introduces plenty of the
peerage, but it cannot be said that he is always at ease in their
society.&nbsp; He remembers that they are lords, and is on his
guard, very often, and suspicious and sarcastic, except, perhaps
when he deals with a gentleman like Lord Kew.&nbsp; He examines
them like curious wild animals in the Jardin des Plantes.&nbsp;
He is an accomplished naturalist, and not afraid of the lion; but
he remembers that the animal is royal, and has a title.&nbsp; Mr.
Norris, for instance, shows nothing of this mood.&nbsp; Mr.
Trollope was not afraid of his Dukes: he thought none the worse
of a man because he was the high and puissant prince of
Omnium.&nbsp; As for most novelists, they no longer paint
fashionable society with enthusiasm.&nbsp; Mr. Henry James has
remarked that young British peers favour the word
&ldquo;beastly,&rdquo;&mdash;a point which does not always
impress itself into other people so keenly as into Mr. Henry
James.&nbsp; In reading him you do not forget that his Tufts are
Tufts.&nbsp; But then Tufts are really strange animals to the
denizens of the Great Republic.&nbsp; Perhaps the modern realism
has made novelists desert the world where Dukes and Dowagers
abound.&nbsp; Novelists do not know very much about it; they are
not wont to haunt the gilded saloons, and they prefer to write
about the manners which they know.&nbsp; A very good novel, in
these strange ruinous times, might be written with a Duke for
hero; but nobody writes it, and, if anybody did write it in the
modern manner, it would not in the least resemble the old
fashionable novel.</p>
<p>Here a curious point arises.&nbsp; We have all studied the
ingenious lady who calls herself Ouida.&nbsp; Now, is Ouida, or
rather was Ouida in her early state sublime, the last of the old
fashionable novelists, or did Thackeray unconsciously prophesy of
her when he wrote his burlesque <i>Lords and Liveries</i>?&nbsp;
Think of the young earl of Bagnigge, &ldquo;who was never heard
to admire anything except a <i>coulis de dindonneau &agrave; la
St. Men&eacute;hould</i>, . . . or the bouquet of a flask of
M&eacute;doc, of Carbonnell&rsquo;s best quality, or a
<i>goutte</i> of Marasquin, from the cellars of Briggs and
Hobson.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have met such young patricians in
<i>Under Two Flags</i> and <i>Idalia</i>.&nbsp; But then there is
a difference: Ouida never tells us that her hero was &ldquo;blest
with a mother of excellent principles, who had imbued his young
mind with that morality which is so superior to all the vain
pomps of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; But a hero of Ouida&rsquo;s
might easily have had a father who &ldquo;was struck down by the
side of the gallant Collingwood in the Bay of Fundy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The heroes themselves may have &ldquo;looked at the Pyramids
without awe, at the Alps without reverence.&rdquo;&nbsp; They do
say &ldquo;<i>Corpo di Bacco</i>,&rdquo; and the Duca de
Montepulciano does reply, &ldquo;<i>E&rsquo; bellissima
certamente</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And their creator might conceivably
remark &ldquo;Non cuivis contigit.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Lady Fanny
Flummery&rsquo;s ladies could not dress as Ouida&rsquo;s ladies
do: they could not quote Petronius Arbiter; they had never heard
of Suetonius.&nbsp; No age reproduces itself.&nbsp; There is much
of our old fashionable authoress in Ouida&rsquo;s earlier tales;
there is plenty of the Peerage, plenty of queer French in old
novels and Latin yet more queer; but where is the
<i>&eacute;lan</i> which takes arch&aelig;ology with a rush,
which sticks at no adventure, however nobly incredible? where is
the pathos, the simplicity, the purple splendour of Ouida&rsquo;s
manner, or manners?&nbsp; No, the spirit of the world, mirroring
itself in the minds of individuals, simpered, and that simper was
Lady Fanny Flummery.&nbsp; But it did many things more portentous
than simpering, when it reflected itself in Ouida.</p>
<p>Is it that we do no longer gape on the aristocracy admiringly,
and write of them curiously, as if they were creatures in a
Paradise?&nbsp; Is it that Thackeray has converted us?&nbsp; In
part, surely, we are just as snobbish as ever, though the gods of
our adoration totter to their fall, and &ldquo;a hideous
hum&rdquo; from the mob outside thrills through the
temples.&nbsp; In fiction, on the other hand, the world of
fashion is &ldquo;played out.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nobody cares to read
or write about the dear duchess.&nbsp; If a peer comes into a
novel he comes in, not as a coroneted curiosity, but as a man,
just as if he were a dentist, or a stockbroker.&nbsp; His rank is
an accident; it used to be the essence of his luminous
apparition.&nbsp; I scarce remember a lord in all the many works
of Mr. Besant, nor do they people the romances of Mr.
Black.&nbsp; Mr. Kipling does not deal in them, nor Mr. George
Meredith much; Mr. Haggard hardly gets beyond a baronet, and
<i>he</i> wears chain mail in Central Africa, and tools with an
axe.&nbsp; Mrs. Oliphant has a Scotch peer, but he is less
interesting and prominent than his family ghost.&nbsp; No, we
have only Ouida left, and Mr. Norris&mdash;who writes about
people of fashion, indeed, but who has nothing in him of the old
fashionable novelist.</p>
<p>Is it to a Republic, to France, that we must look for our
fashionable novels&mdash;to France and to America.&nbsp; Every
third person in M. Guy de Maupassant&rsquo;s tales has a
&ldquo;de,&rdquo; and is a Marquis or a Vicomte.&nbsp; As for M.
Paul Bourget, one really can be happy with him in the fearless
old fashion.&nbsp; With him we meet Lord Henry Bohun, and M. De
Casal (a Vicomte), and all the Marquises and <i>Marquises</i>;
and all the pale blue boudoirs, and sentimental Duchesses, whose
hearts are only too good, and who get into the most complicated
amorous scrapes.&nbsp; That young Republican, M. Bourget,
sincerely loves a <i>blason</i>, a pedigree, diamonds, lace,
silver dressing cases, silver baths, essences, pomatums, <i>le
grand luxe</i>.&nbsp; So does Gyp: apart from her wit, Gyp is
delightful to read, introducing us to the very best of bad
company.&nbsp; Even M. Fortune du Boisgobey likes a Vicomte, and
is partial to the <i>noblesse</i>, while M. Georges Ohnet is
accused of entering the golden world of rank, like a man without
a wedding garment, and of being lost and at sea among his
aristocrats.&nbsp; They order these things better in France: they
still appeal to the fine old natural taste for rank and luxury,
splendour and refinement.&nbsp; What is Gyp but a Lady Fanny
Flummery <i>r&eacute;ussie</i>,&mdash;Lady Fanny with the
trifling additional qualities of wit and daring?&nbsp; Observe
her noble scorn of M. George Ohnet: it is a fashionable
arrogance.</p>
<p>To my mind, I confess, the decay of the British fashionable
novel seems one of the most threatening signs of the times.&nbsp;
Even in France institutions are much more permanent than
here.&nbsp; In France they have fashionable novels, and very good
novels too: no man of sense will deny that they are far better
than our dilettantism of the slums, or our religious and social
tracts in the disguise of romance.&nbsp; If there is no new tale
of treasure and bandits and fights and lions handy, may I have a
fashionable novel in French to fall back upon!&nbsp; Even Count
Tolsto&iuml; does not disdain the <i>genre</i>.&nbsp; There is
some uncommonly high life in <i>Anna Kar&eacute;nine</i>.&nbsp;
He adds a great deal of psychology, to be sure; so does M. Paul
Bourget.&nbsp; But he takes you among smart people, who have
everything handsome about them&mdash;titles, and lands, and
rents.&nbsp; Is it not a hard thing that an honest British snob,
if he wants to move in the highest circles of fiction, must turn
to French novelists, or Russian, or American?&nbsp; As to the
American novels of the <i>&eacute;lite</i> and the <i>beau
monde</i>, their elegance is obscured to English eyes, because
that which makes one New Yorker better than another, that which
creates the Upper Ten Thousand (dear phrase!) of New York, is so
inconspicuous.&nbsp; For example, the scientific inquirer may
venture himself among the novels of two young American
authors.&nbsp; Few English students make this voyage of
exploration.&nbsp; But the romances of these ingenious writers
are really, or really try to be, a kind of fashionable
novels.&nbsp; It is a queer domain of fashion, to be sure,
peopled by the strangest aborigines, who talk and are talked
about in a language most interesting to the philologist.&nbsp;
Here poor Lady Fanny Flummery would have been sadly to seek, for
her characters, though noble, were moral, and her pen was wielded
on the side of Church and State.&nbsp; But these western
fashionables have morals and a lingo of their own, made in equal
parts of the American idioms and of expressions transferred from
the jargon of Decadence and the <i>Parnassiculet
Contemporain</i>.&nbsp; As one peruses these novels one thinks of
a new tale to be told&mdash;<i>The Last of the Fashionables</i>,
who died away, like the buffalo and the grisly bear, in some
ca&ntilde;on or forest of the Wild West.&nbsp; I think this
distinguished being, <i>Ultimus hominum venustiorum</i>, will
find the last remnants of the Gentlemanly Party in some Indian
tribe, Apaches or Sioux.&nbsp; I see him raised to the rank of
chief, and leading the red-skinned and painted cavaliers on the
war-path against the Vulgarians of the ultimate Democracy.&nbsp;
To depict this dandy chief would require the art at once of a
Cooper and a Ouida.&nbsp; Let me attempt&mdash;</p>
<h3>THE LAST FIGHT OF FOUR HAIR-BRUSHES</h3>
<p>By this time the Sioux were flying in all directions, mowed
down by the fire of Gatling and Maxim guns.&nbsp; The scrub of
Little Big Horn Creek was strewn with the bodies of writhing
braves.&nbsp; On the livid and volcanic heights of Mount
Buncombe, the painted tents were blazing merrily.&nbsp; But on a
mound above the creek, an ancient fortress of some long-forgotten
people, a small group of Indian horsemen, might be observed,
steady as rocks in the refluent tide of war.&nbsp; The fire from
their Winchester repeaters blazed out like the streamers of the
Northern Lights.&nbsp; Again and again the flower of the United
States army had charged up the mound, only to recoil in flight,
or to line the cliff with their corpses.&nbsp; The First Irish
Cuirassiers had been annihilated: Parnell&rsquo;s own, alas! in
the heat of the combat had turned their fratricidal black-thorns
on M&rsquo;Carthy&rsquo;s brigade, and these two gallant
squadrons were mixed and broken, falling beneath the blows of
brothers estranged.</p>
<p>But at last the fire from the Redmen on the bluff slackened
and grew silent.&nbsp; The ammunition was exhausted.&nbsp; There
was a movement in the group of braves.&nbsp; Crazy Horse and Bald
Coyote turned to Four Hair-Brushes, who sat his steed Atalanta,
last winner of the last Grand National, with all the old careless
elegance of the Row.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four Hair-Brushes,&rdquo; said Crazy Horse (and a tear
rolled down his painted cheek), &ldquo;nought is left but
flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then fly,&rdquo; said Four Hair-Brushes, languidly,
lighting a cigarette, which he took from a diamond-studded gold
<i>&eacute;tui</i>, the gift of the Kaiser in old days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, not without the White Chief,&rdquo; said Bald
Coyote; and he seized the reins of Four Hair-Brushes, to lead him
from that stricken field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vous &ecirc;tes trop vieux jeu, mon ami,&rdquo;
murmured Four Hair-Brushes, &ldquo;je ne suis ni Edouard II., ni
Charles Edouard &agrave; Culloden.&nbsp; Quatre-brosses meurt,
mais il ne se rend pas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian released his hold, baffled by the erudition and the
calm courage of his captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make tracks,&rdquo; he said; and, swinging round so
that his horse concealed his body, he galloped down the bluff,
and through the American cavalry, scattering death from the
arrows which he loosed under his horse&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>Four Hair-Brushes was alone.</p>
<p>Unarmed, as ever, he sat, save for the hunting-whip in his
right hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scalp him!&rdquo; yelled the Friendly Crows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, take him alive: a seemlier knight never backed
steed!&rdquo; cried the gallant Americans.</p>
<p>From their midst rode a courteous cavalier, Captain John
Barry, the scholar, the hero of sword and pen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yield thee, Sir Knight!&rdquo; he said, doffing his
<i>k&eacute;pi</i> in martial courtesy.</p>
<p>Four Hair-Brushes replied to his salute, and was opening his
curved and delicate lips to speak, when a chance bullet struck
him full in the breast.&nbsp; He threw up his arms, reeled, and
fell.&nbsp; The gallant American, leaping from saddle to ground,
rushed to raise his head.</p>
<p>Through the war-paint he recognised him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Heaven!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;it
is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; whispered Four Hair-Brushes, with a weary
smile: &ldquo;let Annesley de Vere of the Blues die
unnamed.&nbsp; Tell them that I fell in harness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did, indeed.&nbsp; Under his feathered and painted cloak
Barry found that Annesley, ever careful of his figure, ever loyal
in love, the last of the Dandies, yet wore the corset of Madame
de Telli&egrave;re.&nbsp; It was wet with his life-blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So dies,&rdquo; said Barry, &ldquo;the last English
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>THACKERAY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I thought how some people&rsquo;s towering intellects
and splendid cultivated geniuses rise upon simple, beautiful
foundations hidden out of sight.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, in his
Letters to Mrs. Brookfield, Mr. Thackeray wrote, after visiting
the crypt of Canterbury Cathedral, with its &ldquo;charming,
harmonious, powerful combination of arches and shafts, beautiful
whichever way you see them developed, like a fine
music.&rdquo;&nbsp; The simile applies to his own character and
genius, to his own and perhaps to that of most great authors,
whose works are our pleasure and comfort in this troublesome
world.&nbsp; There are critics who profess a desire to hear
nothing, or as little as may be, of the lives of great artists,
whether their instrument of art was the pen, or the brush, or the
chisel, or the strings and reeds of music.&nbsp; With those
critics perhaps most of us agree, when we read books that gossip
about Shelley, or Coleridge, or Byron.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give us their
poetry,&rdquo; we say, &ldquo;and leave their characters alone:
we do not want tattle about Claire and chatter about Harriet; we
want to be happy with &lsquo;The Skylark&rsquo; or &lsquo;The
Cloud.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Possibly this instinct is correct,
where such a poet as Shelley is concerned, whose life, like his
poetry, was as &ldquo;the life of winds and tides,&rdquo; whose
genius, unlike the skylark&rsquo;s, was more true to the point of
heaven than the point of home.&nbsp; But reflection shows us that
on the whole, as Mr. Thackeray says, a man&rsquo;s genius must be
builded on the foundations of his character.&nbsp; Where that
genius deals with the mingled stuff of human life&mdash;sorrow,
desire, love, hatred, kindness, meanness&mdash;then the
foundation of character is especially important.&nbsp; People are
sometimes glad that we know so little of Shakespeare the man; yet
who can doubt that a true revelation of his character would be
not less worthy, noble and charming than the general effect of
his poems?&nbsp; In him, it is certain, we should always find an
example of nobility, of generosity, of charity and kindness and
self-forgetfulness.&nbsp; Indeed, we find these qualities, as a
rule, in the biographies of the great sympathetic poets and men
of genius of the pen&mdash;I do not say in the lives of rebels of
genius, &ldquo;meteoric poets&rdquo; like Byron.&nbsp; The same
basis, the same foundations of rectitude, of honour, of goodness,
of melancholy, and of mirth, underlie the art of Moli&egrave;re,
of Scott, of Fielding, and as his correspondence shows, of
Thackeray.</p>
<p>It seems probable that a complete biography of Thackeray will
never be written.&nbsp; It was his wish to live in his works
alone: that wish his descendants respect; and we must probably
regard the Letters to Mr. and Mrs. Brookfield as the last private
and authentic record of the man which will be given, at least to
this generation.&nbsp; In these Letters all sympathetic readers
will find the man they have long known from his
writings&mdash;the man with a heart so tender that the world
often drove him back into a bitterness of opposition, into an
assumed hardness and defensive cynicism.&nbsp; There are readers
so unluckily constituted that they can see nothing in Thackeray
but this bitterness, this cruel sense of meanness and power of
analysing shabby emotions, sneaking vanities, contemptible
ambitions.&nbsp; All of us must often feel with regret that he
allowed himself to be made too unhappy by the spectacle of
failings so common in the world he knew best, that he dwelt on
them too long and lashed them too complacently.&nbsp; One hopes
never to read &ldquo;Lovel the Widower&rdquo; again, and one
gladly skips some of the speeches of the Old Campaigner in
&ldquo;The Newcomes.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are terrible, but not more
terrible than life.&nbsp; Yet it is hard to understand how Mr.
Ruskin, for example, can let such scenes and characters hide from
his view the kindness, gentleness, and pity of Thackeray&rsquo;s
nature.&nbsp; The Letters must open all eyes that are not
wilfully closed, and should at last overcome every prejudice.</p>
<p>In the Letters we see a man literally hungering and thirsting
after affection, after love&mdash;a man cut off by a cruel stroke
of fate from his natural solace, from the centre of a home.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;God took from me a lady dear,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he says, in the most touching medley of doggerel and poetry,
made &ldquo;instead of writing my <i>Punch</i> this
morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; Losing &ldquo;a lady dear,&rdquo; he takes
refuge as he may, he finds comfort as he can, in all the
affections within his reach, in the society of an old college
friend and of his wife, in the love of all children, beginning
with his own; in a generous liking for all good work and for all
good fellows.</p>
<p>Did any man of letters except Scott ever write of his rivals
as Thackeray wrote of Dickens?&nbsp; Artists are a jealous
race.&nbsp; &ldquo;Potter hates potter, and poet hates
poet,&rdquo; as Hesiod said so long ago.&nbsp; This jealousy is
not mere envy, it is really a strong sense of how things ought to
be done, in any art, touched with a natural preference for a
man&rsquo;s own way of doing them.&nbsp; Now, what could be more
unlike than the &ldquo;ways&rdquo; of Dickens and
Thackeray?&nbsp; The subjects chosen by these great authors are
not more diverse than their styles.&nbsp; Thackeray writes like a
scholar, not in the narrow sense, but rather as a student and a
master of all the refinements and resources of language.&nbsp;
Dickens copies the chaff of the street, or he roams into
melodramatics, &ldquo;drops into poetry&rdquo;&mdash;blank verse
at least&mdash;and touches all with peculiarities, we might say
mannerisms, of his own.&nbsp; I have often thought, and even
tried to act on the thought, that some amusing imaginary letters
might be written, from characters of Dickens about characters of
Thackeray, from characters of Thackeray about characters of
Dickens.&nbsp; They might be supposed to meet each other in
society, and describe each other.&nbsp; Can you not fancy Captain
Costigan on Dick Swiveller, Blanche Amory on Agnes, Pen on David
Copperfield, and that &ldquo;tiger&rdquo; Steerforth?&nbsp; What
would the family solicitor of &ldquo;The Newcomes&rdquo; have to
say of Mr. Tulkinghorn?&nbsp; How would George Warrington
appreciate Mr. Pickwick?&nbsp; Yes, the two great novelists were
as opposed as two men could be&mdash;in manner, in style, in
knowledge of books, and of the world.&nbsp; And yet how admirably
Thackeray writes about Dickens, in his letters as in his
books!&nbsp; How he delights in him!&nbsp; How manly is that
emulation which enables an author to see all the points in his
rival, and not to carp at them, but to praise, and be stimulated
to keener effort!</p>
<p>Consider this passage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you read
Dickens?&nbsp; O! it is charming!&nbsp; Brave Dickens!&nbsp; It
has some of his very prettiest touches&mdash;those inimitable
Dickens touches which make such a great man of him, and the
reading of the book has done another author a great deal of
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thackeray is just as generous, and perhaps more critical, in
writing of Kingsley.&nbsp; &ldquo;A fine, honest, go-a-head
fellow, who charges a subject heartily, impetuously, with the
greatest courage and simplicity; but with narrow eyes (his are
extraordinarily brave, blue and honest), and with little
knowledge of the world, I think.&nbsp; But he is superior to us
worldlings in many ways, and I wish I had some of his honest
pluck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have often wished that great authors, when their days of
creation were over, when &ldquo;their minds grow grey and
bald,&rdquo; would condescend to tell us the history of their
books.&nbsp; Sir Walter Scott did something of this kind in the
prefaces to the last edition of the Waverley Novels published
during his life.&nbsp; What can be more interesting than his
account, in the introduction to the &ldquo;Fortunes of
Nigel,&rdquo; of how he worked, how he planned, and found all his
plots and plans overridden by the demon at the end of his
pen!&nbsp; But Sir Walter was failing when he began those
literary confessions; good as they are, he came to them too
late.&nbsp; Yet these are not confessions which an author can
make early.&nbsp; The pagan Aztecs only confessed once in a
lifetime&mdash;in old age, when they had fewer temptations to
fall to their old loves: then they made a clean breast of it once
for all.&nbsp; So it might be with an author.&nbsp; While he is
in his creative vigour, we want to hear about his fancied
persons, about Pendennis, Beatrix, Becky, not about himself, and
how he invented them.&nbsp; But when he has passed his best, then
it is he who becomes of interest; it is about himself that we
wish him to speak, as far as he modestly may.&nbsp; Who would not
give &ldquo;Lovel the Widower&rdquo; and &ldquo;Philip&rdquo; for
some autobiographical and literary prefaces to the older
novels?&nbsp; They need not have been more egotistic than the
&ldquo;Roundabout Papers.&rdquo;&nbsp; They would have had far
more charm.&nbsp; Some things cannot be confessed.&nbsp; We do
not ask who was the original Sir Pitt Crawley, or the original
Blanche Amory.&nbsp; But we might learn in what mood, in what
circumstances the author wrote this passage or that.</p>
<p>The Letters contain a few notes of this kind, a few literary
confessions.&nbsp; We hear that Emmy Sedley was partly suggested
by Mrs. Brookfield, partly by Thackeray&rsquo;s mother, much by
his own wife.&nbsp; There scarce seems room for so many elements
in Emmy&rsquo;s personality.&nbsp; For some reason ladies love
her not, nor do men adore her.&nbsp; I have been her faithful
knight ever since I was ten years old and read &ldquo;Vanity
Fair&rdquo; somewhat stealthily.&nbsp; Why does one like her
except because she is such a thorough woman?&nbsp; She is not
clever, she is not very beautiful, she is unhappy, and she can be
jealous.&nbsp; One pities her, and that is akin to a more tender
sentiment; one pities her while she sits in the corner, and
Becky&rsquo;s green eyes flatter her oaf of a husband; one pities
her in the poverty of her father&rsquo;s house, in the famous
battle over Daffy&rsquo;s Elixir, in the separation from the
younger George.&nbsp; You begin to wish some great joy to come to
her: it does not come unalloyed; you know that Dobbin had bad
quarters of an hour with this lady, and had to disguise a little
of his tenderness for his own daughter.&nbsp; Yes, Emmy is more
complex than she seems, and perhaps it needed three ladies to
contribute the various elements of her person and her
character.&nbsp; One of them, the jealous one, lent a touch to
Helen Pendennis, to Laura, to Lady Castlewood.&nbsp; Probably
this may be the reason why some persons dislike Thackeray
so.&nbsp; His very best women are not angels. <a
name="citation109"></a><a href="#footnote109"
class="citation">[109]</a>&nbsp; Are the very best women
angels?&nbsp; It is a pious opinion&mdash;that borders on
heresy.</p>
<p>When the Letters began to be written, in 1847, Thackeray had
his worst years, in a worldly sense, behind him.&nbsp; They were
past: the times when he wrote in <i>Galignani</i> for ten francs
a day.&nbsp; Has any literary ghoul disinterred his old ten-franc
articles in <i>Galignani</i>?&nbsp; The time of &ldquo;Barry
Lyndon,&rdquo; too, was over.&nbsp; He says nothing of that
masterpiece, and only a word about &ldquo;The Great Hoggarty
Diamond.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been re-reading it.&nbsp;
Upon my word and honour, if it doesn&rsquo;t make you cry, I
shall have a mean opinion of you.&nbsp; It was written at a time
of great affliction, when my heart was very soft and
humble.&nbsp; Amen.&nbsp; Ich habe auch viel
geliebt.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of &ldquo;Pendennis,&rdquo; as it goes on,
he writes that it is &ldquo;awfully stupid,&rdquo; which has not
been the verdict of the ages.&nbsp; He picks up materials as he
passes.&nbsp; He dines with some officers, and perhaps he
stations them at Chatteris.&nbsp; He meets Miss G---, and her
converse suggests a love passage between Pen and Blanche.&nbsp;
Why did he dislike fair women so?&nbsp; It runs all through his
novels.&nbsp; Becky is fair.&nbsp; Blanche is fair.&nbsp; Outside
the old yellow covers of &ldquo;Pendennis,&rdquo; you see the
blonde mermaid, &ldquo;amusing, and clever, and depraved,&rdquo;
dragging the lover to the sea, and the nut-brown maid holding him
back.&nbsp; Angelina, of the &ldquo;Rose and the Ring,&rdquo; is
the Becky of childhood; she is fair, and the good Rosalba is
<i>brune</i>.&nbsp; In writing &ldquo;Pendennis&rdquo; he had a
singular experience.&nbsp; He looked over his own &ldquo;back
numbers,&rdquo; and found &ldquo;a passage which I had utterly
forgotten as if I had never read or written it.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
Lockhart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life of Scott,&rdquo; James Ballantyne
says that &ldquo;when the &lsquo;Bride of Lammermoor&rsquo; was
first put into his hands in a complete shape, he did not
recollect one single incident, character, or conversation it
contained.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is to say, he remembered nothing of
his own invention, though his memory of the traditional parts was
as clear as ever.&nbsp; Ballantyne remarks, &ldquo;The history of
the human mind contains nothing more wonderful.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
experience of Thackeray is a parallel to that of Scott.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pendennis,&rdquo; it must be noted, was interrupted by a
severe illness, and &ldquo;The Bride of Lammermoor&rdquo; was
dictated by Sir Walter when in great physical pain.&nbsp; On one
occasion Thackeray &ldquo;lit upon a very stupid part of
&lsquo;Pendennis,&rsquo; I am sorry to say; and yet how well
written it is!&nbsp; What a shame the author don&rsquo;t write a
complete good story!&nbsp; Will he die before doing so? or come
back from America and do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did he ever write &ldquo;a complete, good story&rdquo;?&nbsp;
Did any one ever do such a thing as write a three-volume, novel,
or a novel of equal length, which was &ldquo;a complete, good
story&rdquo;?&nbsp; Probably not; or if any mortal ever succeeded
in the task, it was the great Alexander Dumas.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Three Musketeers,&rdquo; I take leave to think, and &ldquo;Twenty
Years After,&rdquo; are complete good stories, good from
beginning to end, stories from beginning to end without a break,
without needless episode.&nbsp; Perhaps one may say as much for
&ldquo;Old Mortality,&rdquo; and for &ldquo;Quentin
Durward.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Scott and Dumas were born
story-tellers; narrative was the essence of their genius at its
best; the current of romance rolls fleetly on, bearing with it
persons and events, mirroring scenes, but never ceasing to be the
main thing&mdash;the central interest.&nbsp; Perhaps narrative
like this is the chief success of the novelist.&nbsp; He is
triumphant when he carries us on, as Wolf, the famous critic, was
carried on by the tide of the Iliad, &ldquo;in that pure and
rapid current of action.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nobody would claim this
especial merit for Thackeray.&nbsp; He is one of the greatest of
novelists; he displays human nature and human conduct so that we
forget ourselves in his persons, but he does not make us forget
ourselves in their fortunes.&nbsp; Whether Clive does or does not
marry Ethel, or Esmond, Beatrix, does not very greatly excite our
curiosity.&nbsp; We cannot ring the bells for Clive&rsquo;s
second wedding as the villagers celebrated the bridal of
Pamela.&nbsp; It is the development of character, it is the
author&rsquo;s comments, it is his own personality and his
unmatched and inimitable style, that win our admiration and
affection.&nbsp; We can take up &ldquo;Vanity Fair,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Pendennis,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Newcomes,&rdquo; just
where the book opens by chance, and read them with delight, as we
may read Montaigne.&nbsp; When one says one can take up a book
anywhere, it generally means that one can also lay it down
anywhere.&nbsp; But it is not so with Thackeray.&nbsp; Whenever
we meet him he holds us with his charm, his humour, his
eloquence, his tenderness.&nbsp; If he has not, in the highest
degree, the narrative power, he does possess, in a degree perhaps
beyond any other writer of English, that kind of poetic quality
which is not incompatible with prose writing.</p>
<p>A great deal has been said about prose poetry.&nbsp; As a
rule, it is very poor stuff.&nbsp; As prose it has a tendency to
run into blank verse; as poetry it is highly rhetorical and
self-conscious.&nbsp; It would be invidious and might be
irritating to select examples from modern masters of
prose-poetry.&nbsp; They have never been poets.&nbsp; But the
prose of a poet like Milton may be, and is, poetical in the true
sense; and so, upon occasions, was the prose of Thackeray.&nbsp;
Some examples linger always in the memory, and dwell with their
music in the hearing.&nbsp; One I have quoted elsewhere; the
passage in &ldquo;The Newcomes&rdquo; where Clive, at the lecture
on the Poetry of the Domestic Affections, given by Sir Barnes
Newcome, sees Ethel, whom he has lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the past, and its dear histories, and youth and its
hopes and passions, and tones and looks, for ever echoing in the
heart and present in the memory&mdash;those, no doubt, poor Clive
saw and heard as he looked across the great gulf of time and
parting and grief, and beheld the woman he had loved for many
years.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The great gulf of time, and parting,
and grief,&rdquo;&mdash;some of us are on the farther side of it,
and our old selves, and our old happiness, and our old affections
beyond, grow near, grow clear, now and then, at the sight of a
face met by chance in the world, at the chance sound of a
voice.&nbsp; Such are human fortunes, and human sorrows; not the
worst, not the greatest, for these old loves do not
die&mdash;they live in exile, and are the better parts of our
souls.&nbsp; Not the greatest, nor the worst of sorrows, for
shame is worse, and hopeless hunger, and a life all of barren
toil without distractions, without joy, must be far worse.&nbsp;
But of those myriad tragedies of the life of the poor, Thackeray
does not write.&nbsp; How far he was aware of them, how deeply he
felt them, we are not informed.&nbsp; His highest tragedy is that
of the hunger of the heart; his most noble prose sounds in that
meeting of Harry Esmond with Lady Castlewood, in the immortal
speech which has the burden, &ldquo;bringing your sheaves with
you!&rdquo;&nbsp; All that scene appears to me no less unique, no
less unsurpassable, no less perfect, than the &ldquo;Ode to the
Nightingale&rdquo; of Keats, or the <i>Lycidas</i> of
Milton.&nbsp; It were superfluous to linger over the humour of
Thackeray.&nbsp; Only Shakespeare and Dickens have graced the
language with so many happy memories of queer, pleasant people,
with so many quaint phrases, each of which has a kind of
freemasonry, and when uttered, or recalled, makes all friends of
Thackeray into family friends of each other.&nbsp; The sayings of
Mr. Harry Foker, of Captain Costigan, of Gumbo, are all like old
dear family phrases, they live imperishable and always new, like
the words of Sir John, the fat knight, or of Sancho Panza, or of
Dick Swiveller, or that other Sancho, Sam Weller.&nbsp; They have
that Shakespearian gift of being ever appropriate, and undyingly
fresh.</p>
<p>These are among the graces of Thackeray, these and that
inimitable style, which always tempts and always baffles the
admiring and despairing copyist.&nbsp; Where did he find the
trick of it, of the words which are invariably the best words,
and invariably fall exactly in the best places?&nbsp; &ldquo;The
best words in the best places,&rdquo; is part of
Coleridge&rsquo;s definition of poetry; it is also the essence of
Thackeray&rsquo;s prose.&nbsp; In these Letters to Mrs.
Brookfield the style is precisely the style of the novels and
essays.&nbsp; The style, with Thackeray, was the man.&nbsp; He
could not write otherwise.&nbsp; But probably, to the last, this
perfection was not mechanical, was not attained without labour
and care.&nbsp; In Dr. John Brown&rsquo;s works, in his essay on
Thackeray, there is an example of a proof-sheet on which the
master has made corrections, and those corrections bring the
passage up to his accustomed level, to the originality of his
rhythm.&nbsp; Here is the piece:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Another Finis, another slice of life which
<i>Tempus edax</i> has devoured!&nbsp; And I may have to write
the word once or twice, perhaps, and then an end of Ends.&nbsp;
[Finite is ever and Infinite beginning.]&nbsp; Oh, the troubles,
the cares, the <i>ennui</i>, [the complications,] the
repetitions, the old conversations over and over again, and here
and there all the delightful passages, the dear, the brief, the
forever-remembered!</p>
<p>&ldquo;[And then]&nbsp; A few chapters more, and then the
last, and behold Finis itself coming to an end, and the Infinite
beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How like music this,&rdquo; writes Dr. John
Brown&mdash;&ldquo;like one trying the same air in different
ways, as it were, searching out and sounding all its
depths!&rdquo;&nbsp; The words were almost the last that
Thackeray wrote, perhaps the very last.&nbsp; They reply, as it
were, to other words which he had written long before to Mrs.
Brookfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pity anybody who leaves the world; not
even a fair young girl in her prime; I pity those
remaining.&nbsp; On her journey, if it pleases God to send her,
depend on it there&rsquo;s no cause for grief, that&rsquo;s but
an earthly condition.&nbsp; Out of our stormy life, and brought
nearer the Divine light and warmth, there must be a serene
climate.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you fancy sailing into the
calm?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah! nowhere else shall we find the Golden Bride,
&ldquo;passionless bride, divine Tranquillity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As human nature persistently demands a moral, and, as, to say
truth, Thackeray was constantly meeting the demand, what is the
lesson of his life and his writings?&nbsp; So people may ask, and
yet how futile is the answer!&nbsp; Life has a different meaning,
a different riddle, a different reply for each of us.&nbsp; There
is not one sphinx, but many sphinxes&mdash;as many as there are
women and men.&nbsp; We must all answer for ourselves.&nbsp;
Pascal has one answer, &ldquo;Believe!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Moli&egrave;re has another, &ldquo;Observe!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thackeray&rsquo;s answer is, &ldquo;Be good and enjoy!&rdquo; but
a melancholy enjoyment was his.&nbsp; Dr. John Brown says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;His persistent state, especially for the later half of
his life, was profoundly <i>morne</i>, there is no other word for
it.&nbsp; This arose in part from temperament, from a quick sense
of the littleness and wretchedness of mankind . . . This feeling,
acting on a harsh and savage nature, ended in the <i>s&aelig;va
indignatio</i> of Swift; acting on the kindly and sensitive
nature of Mr. Thackeray, it led only to compassionate
sadness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great part of his life, and most of his happiness, lay in
love.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ich habe auch viel geliebt,&rdquo; he says,
and it is a hazardous kind of happiness that attends great
affection.&nbsp; Your capital is always at the mercy of failures,
of death, of jealousy, of estrangement.&nbsp; But he had so much
love to give that he could not but trust those perilous
investments.</p>
<p>Other troubles he had that may have been diversions from
those.&nbsp; He did not always keep that manly common sense in
regard to criticism, which he shows in a letter to Mrs.
Brookfield.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you read the
<i>Spectator&rsquo;s</i> sarcastic notice of &lsquo;Vanity
Fair&rsquo;?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think it is just, but think
Kintoul (Rintoul?) is a very honest man, and rather inclined to
deal severely with his private friends lest he should fall into
the other extreme: to be sure he keeps out of it, I mean the
other extreme, very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is the way to take unfavourable criticisms&mdash;not to
go declaring that a man is your enemy because he does not like
your book, your ballads, your idyls, your sermons, what you
please.&nbsp; Why cannot people keep literature and liking
apart?&nbsp; Am I bound to think Jones a bad citizen, a bad man,
a bad householder, because his poetry leaves me cold?&nbsp; Need
he regard me as a malevolent green-eyed monster, because I
don&rsquo;t want to read him?&nbsp; Thackeray was not always true
in his later years to these excellent principles.&nbsp; He was
troubled about trifles of criticisms and gossip,
<i>bagatelles</i> not worth noticing, still less worth
remembering and recording.&nbsp; Do not let us record them,
then.</p>
<p>We cannot expect for Thackeray, we cannot even desire for him,
a popularity like that of Dickens.&nbsp; If ever any man wrote
for the people, it was Dickens.&nbsp; Where can we find such a
benefactor, and who has lightened so many lives with such
merriment as he?&nbsp; But Thackeray wrote, like the mass of
authors, for the literary class&mdash;for all who have the sense
of style, the delight in the best language.&nbsp; He will endure
while English literature endures, while English civilisation
lasts.&nbsp; We cannot expect all the world to share our
affection for this humourist whose mirth springs from his
melancholy.&nbsp; His religion, his education, his life in this
unsatisfying world, are not the life, the education, the religion
of the great majority of human kind.&nbsp; He cannot reach so
many ears and hearts as Shakespeare or Dickens, and some of those
whom he reaches will always and inevitably misjudge him.&nbsp;
<i>Mais c&rsquo;est mon homme</i>, one may say, as La Fontaine
said of Moli&egrave;re.&nbsp; Of modern writers, putting Scott
aside, he is to me the most friendly and sympathetic.&nbsp; Great
genius as he was, he was also a penman, a journalist; and
journalists and penmen will always look to him as their big
brother, the man in their own line of whom they are
proudest.&nbsp; As devout Catholics did not always worship the
greatest saints, but the friendliest saints, their own, so we
scribes burn our cheap incense to St. William Makepeace.&nbsp; He
could do all that any of us could do, and he did it infinitely
better.&nbsp; A piece of verse for <i>Punch</i>, a paragraph, a
caricature, were not beneath the dignity of the author of
&ldquo;Esmond.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had the kindness and helpfulness
which I, for one, have never met a journalist who lacked.&nbsp;
He was a good Englishman; the boy within him never died; he loved
children, and boys, and a little slang, and a boxing match.&nbsp;
If he had failings, who knew them better than he?&nbsp; How often
he is at once the boy at the swishing block and Dr. Birch who
does not spare the rod!&nbsp; Let us believe with that beloved
physician, our old friend Dr. John Brown, that &ldquo;Mr.
Thackeray was much greater, much nobler than his works, great and
noble as they are.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us part with him, remembering
his own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Come wealth or want, come good or ill,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let young and old accept their part,<br />
And bow before the awful Will,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bear it with an honest heart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>DICKENS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot read Dickens!&rdquo;&nbsp; How many people
make this confession, with a front of brass, and do not seem to
know how poor a figure they cut!&nbsp; George Eliot says that a
difference of taste in jokes is a great cause of domestic
discomfort.&nbsp; A difference of taste in books, when it is
decided and vigorous, breaks many a possible friendship, and nips
many a young liking in the bud.&nbsp; I would not willingly seem
intolerant.&nbsp; A man may not like Sophocles, may speak
disrespectfully of Virgil, and even sneer at Herodotus, and yet
may be endured.&nbsp; But he or she (it is usually she) who
contemns Scott, and &ldquo;cannot read Dickens,&rdquo; is a
person with whom I would fain have no further converse.&nbsp; If
she be a lady, and if one meets her at dinner, she must of course
be borne with, and &ldquo;suffered gladly.&rdquo;&nbsp; But she
has dug a gulf that nothing can bridge; she may be fair, clever
and popular, but she is Anathema.&nbsp; I feel towards her (or
him if he wears a beard) as Bucklaw did towards the person who
should make inquiries about that bridal night of Lammermoor.</p>
<p>But this admission does not mean that one is sealed of the
tribe of Charles&mdash;that one is a Dickensite pure and simple,
convinced and devout&mdash;any more than Mr. Matthew Arnold was a
Wordsworthian.&nbsp; Dickens has many such worshippers,
especially (and this is an argument in favour of the faith) among
those who knew him in his life.&nbsp; He must have had a
wonderful charm; for his friends in life are his literary
partisans, his uncompromising partisans, even to this day.&nbsp;
They will have no half-hearted admiration, and scout him who
tries to speak of Dickens as of an artist not flawless, no less
than they scorn him who cannot read Dickens at all.&nbsp; At one
time this honourable enthusiasm (as among the Wordsworthians)
took the shape of &ldquo;endless imitation.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is
over; only here and there is an imitator of the master left in
the land.&nbsp; All his own genius was needed to carry his
mannerisms; the mannerisms without the genius were an armour that
no devoted David had proved, that none could wear with
success.</p>
<p>Of all great writers since Scott, Dickens is probably the man
to whom the world owes most gratitude.&nbsp; No other has caused
so many sad hearts to be lifted up in laughter; no other has
added so much mirth to the toilsome and perplexed life of men, of
poor and rich, of learned and unlearned.&nbsp; &ldquo;A vast hope
has passed across the world,&rdquo; says Alfred de Musset; we may
say that with Dickens a happy smile, a joyous laugh, went round
this earth.&nbsp; To have made us laugh so frequently, so
inextinguishably, so kindly&mdash;that is his great good
deed.&nbsp; It will be said, and with a great deal of truth, that
he has purged us with pity and terror as well as with
laughter.&nbsp; But it is becoming plain that his command of
tears is less assured than of old, and I cannot honestly regret
that some of his pathos&mdash;not all, by any means&mdash;is
losing its charm and its certainty of appeal.&nbsp;
Dickens&rsquo;s humour was rarely too obvious; it was essentially
personal, original, quaint, unexpected, and his own.&nbsp; His
pathos was not infrequently derived from sources open to all the
world, and capable of being drawn from by very commonplace
writers.&nbsp; Little Nells and Dombeys, children unhappy,
overthrown early in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> of the world,
and dying among weeping readers, no longer affect us as they
affected another generation.&nbsp; Mrs. Beecher Stowe and the
author of &ldquo;Misunderstood,&rdquo; once made some people weep
like anything by these simple means.&nbsp; Ouida can do it;
plenty of people can do it.&nbsp; Dickens lives by virtue of what
none but he can do: by virtue of Sairey Gamp, and Sam Weller, and
Dick Swiveller, and Mr. Squeers, with a thousand other old
friends, of whom we can never weary.&nbsp; No more than
Cleopatra&rsquo;s can custom stale <i>their</i> infinite
variety.</p>
<p>I do not say that Dickens&rsquo; pathos is always of the too
facile sort, which plays round children&rsquo;s death-beds.&nbsp;
Other pathos he has, more fine and not less genuine.&nbsp; It may
be morbid and contemptible to feel &ldquo;a great inclination to
cry&rdquo; over David Copperfield&rsquo;s boyish infatuation for
Steerforth; but I feel it.&nbsp; Steerforth was a
&ldquo;tiger,&rdquo;&mdash;as Major Pendennis would have said, a
tiger with his curly hair and his ambrosial whiskers.&nbsp; But
when a little boy loses his heart to a big boy he does not think
of this.&nbsp; Traddles thought of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shame, J.
Steerforth!&rdquo; cried Traddles, when Steerforth bullied the
usher.&nbsp; Traddles had not lost his heart, nor set up the big
boy as a god in the shrine thereof.&nbsp; But boys do these
things; most of us have had our Steerforths&mdash;tall, strong,
handsome, brave, good-humoured.&nbsp; Far off across the years I
see the face of such an one, and remember that emotion which is
described in &ldquo;David Copperfield,&rdquo; chap. xix., towards
the end of the chapter.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know any other
novelist who has touched this young and absolutely disinterested
belief of a little boy in a big one&mdash;touched it so kindly
and seriously, that is there is a hint of it in &ldquo;Dr.
Birch&rsquo;s School Days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dickens is always excellent in his boys, of whom he has
drawn dozens of types&mdash;all capital.&nbsp; There is Tommy
Traddles, for example.&nbsp; And how can people say that Dickens
could not draw a gentleman?&nbsp; The boy who shouted,
&ldquo;Shame, J. Steerforth!&rdquo; was a gentleman, if one may
pretend to have an opinion about a theme so difficult.&nbsp; The
Dodger and Charley Bates are delightful boys&mdash;especially
Bates.&nbsp; Pip, in the good old days, when he was the prowling
boy, and fought Herbert Pocket, was not less attractive, and
Herbert himself, with his theory and practice of the art of
self-defence&mdash;could Nelson have been more brave, or Shelley
(as in Mr. Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s opinion) more
&ldquo;ineffectual&rdquo;?&nbsp; Even the boys at Dotheboys Hall
are each of them quite distinct.&nbsp; Dickens&rsquo;s boys are
almost as dear to me as Thackeray&rsquo;s&mdash;as little Rawdon
himself.&nbsp; There is one exception.&nbsp; I cannot interest
myself in Little Dombey.&nbsp; Little David Copperfield is a
jewel of a boy with a turn for books.&nbsp; Doubtless he is
created out of Dickens&rsquo;s memories of himself as a
child.&nbsp; That is true pathos again, and not overwrought, when
David is sent to Creakle&rsquo;s, and his poor troubled mother
dare hardly say farewell to him.</p>
<p>And this brings us back to that debatable thing&mdash;the
pathos of Dickens&mdash;from which one has been withdrawn by the
attractions of his boys.&nbsp; Little Dombey is a prize example
of his pathos.&nbsp; Little Nell is another.&nbsp; Jeffrey, of
the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, who criticised &ldquo;Marmion&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Lady of the Lake&rdquo; so vindictively, shed
tears over Little Nell.&nbsp; It is a matter of taste, or, as
Science might say, of the lachrymal glands as developed in each
individual.&nbsp; But the lachrymal glands of this amateur are
not developed in that direction.&nbsp; Little Dombey and Little
Nell leave me with a pair of dry eyes.&nbsp; I do not &ldquo;melt
visibly&rdquo; over Little Dombey, like the weak-eyed young man
who took out his books and trunk to the coach.&nbsp; The poor
little chap was feeble and feverish, and had dreams of trying to
stop a river with his childish hands, or to choke it with
sand.&nbsp; It may be very good pathology, but I cannot see that
it is at all right pathos.&nbsp; One does not like copy to be
made out of the sufferings of children or of animals.&nbsp;
One&rsquo;s heart hardens: the object is too manifest, the trick
is too easy.&nbsp; Conceive a child of Dombey&rsquo;s age
remarking, with his latest breath, &ldquo;Tell them that the
picture on the stairs at school is not Divine
enough!&rdquo;&nbsp; That is not the delirium of infancy, that is
art-criticism: it is the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> on Mr. Holman
Hunt.&nbsp; It is not true to nature; it is not good in art: it
is the kind of thing that appears in Sunday-school books about
the virtuous little boy who died.&nbsp; There is more true pathos
in many a page of &ldquo;Huckleberry Finn.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet this
is what Jeffrey gushed over.&nbsp; &ldquo;There has been nothing
like the actual dying of that sweet Paul.&rdquo;&nbsp; So much
can age enfeeble the intellect, that he who had known Scott, and
yet nibbled at his fame, descended to admiring the feeblest of
false sentiment.&nbsp; As for Little Nell, who also has caused
floods of tears to be shed, her case is sufficiently illustrated
by the picture in the first edition (&ldquo;Master
Humphrey&rsquo;s Clock,&rdquo;, 1840, p. 210):</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;When
I die<br />
Put near me something that has loved the light,<br />
And had the sky above it always.&rsquo;&nbsp; Those<br />
Were her words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, gentle, patient, noble Nell was dead!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pathos is about as good as the prose, and <i>that</i> is
blank verse.&nbsp; Are the words in the former quotation in the
least like anything that a little girl would say?&nbsp; A German
sentimentalist might have said them; Obermann might have murmured
them in his weaker moments.&nbsp; Let us try a piece of domestic
pathos by another hand.&nbsp; It is the dawn of Waterloo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heart-stained and shame-stricken, he stood at the
bed&rsquo;s foot, and looked at the sleeping girl.&nbsp; How
dared he&mdash;who was he&mdash;to pray for one so
spotless!&nbsp; God bless her!&nbsp; God bless her!&nbsp; He came
to the bedside, and looked at the hand, the little soft hand,
lying asleep, and he bent over the pillow noiselessly towards the
gentle pale face.&nbsp; Two fair arms closed tenderly round his
neck as he stooped down.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am awake, George,&rsquo;
the poor child said, with a sob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know I am making enemies of a large proportion of the
readers of this page.&nbsp; &ldquo;Odious, sneering beast!&rdquo;
is the quotation which they will apply, perhaps unconscious of
its origin, to a critic who is humble but would fain be honest,
to a critic who thinks that Dickens has his weak places, and that
his pathos is one of these.&nbsp; It cannot be helped.&nbsp; Each
of us has his author who is a favourite, a friend, an idol, whose
immaculate perfection he maintains against all comers.&nbsp; For
example, things are urged against Scott; I receive them in the
attitude of the deaf adder of St. Augustine, who stops one ear
with his tail and presses the other against the dust.&nbsp; The
same with Moli&egrave;re: M. Scherer utters complaints against
Moli&egrave;re!&nbsp; He would not convince me, even if I were
convinced.&nbsp; So, with regard to Dickens, the true believer
will not listen, he will not be persuaded.&nbsp; But if any one
feels a little shaken, let him try it another way.&nbsp; There is
a character in M. Alphonse Daudet&rsquo;s &ldquo;Froment Jeune et
Rissler A&icirc;n&eacute;&rdquo;&mdash;a character who, people
say, is taken bodily from Dickens.&nbsp; This is
D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Delobelle, the deformed girl, the daughter
of <i>un rat&eacute;</i>, a pretentious imbecile actor.&nbsp; She
is poor, stunted, laborious, toiling at a small industry; she is
in love, is rejected, she tries to drown herself, she dies.&nbsp;
The sequence of ideas is in Dickens&rsquo;s vein; but read the
tale, and I think you will see how little the thing is overdone,
how simple and unforced it is, compared with analogous persons
and scenes in the work of the English master.&nbsp; The idiotic
yell of &ldquo;plagiarism&rdquo; has been raised, of course, by
critical <i>cr&eacute;tins</i>.&nbsp; M. Daudet, as I understand
what he says in &ldquo;Trente Ans de Paris,&rdquo; had not read
Dickens at all, when he wrote &ldquo;Froment
Jeune&rdquo;&mdash;certainly had not read &ldquo;Our Mutual
Friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; But there is something of Dickens&rsquo;s
genius in M. Daudet&rsquo;s, and that something is kept much
better in hand by the Frenchman, is more subordinated to the
principles of taste and of truth.</p>
<p>On the other hand, to be done with this point, look at
Delobelle, the father of D&eacute;sir&eacute;e, and compare him
with Dickens&rsquo;s splendid strollers, with Mr. Vincent
Crummles, and Mr. Lenville, and the rest.&nbsp; As in
D&eacute;sir&eacute;e so in Delobelle, M. Daudet&rsquo;s picture
is much the more truthful.&nbsp; But it is truthful with a bitter
kind of truth.&nbsp; Now, there is nothing not genial and
delightful in Crummles and Mrs. Crummles and the Infant
Phenomenon.&nbsp; Here Dickens has got into a region unlike the
region of the pathetic, into a world that welcomes <i>charge</i>
or caricature, the world of humour.&nbsp; We do not know, we
never meet Crummleses quite so unsophisticated as Vincent, who is
&ldquo;not a Prussian,&rdquo; who &ldquo;can&rsquo;t think who
puts these things into the papers.&rdquo;&nbsp; But we do meet
stage people who come very near to this
<i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of self-advertisement, and some of
whom are just as dismal as Crummles is delightful.</p>
<p>Here, no doubt, is Dickens&rsquo;s <i>forte</i>.&nbsp; Here
his genius is all pure gold, in his successful studies or
inventions of the humorous, of character parts.&nbsp; One
literally does not know where to begin or end in one&rsquo;s
admiration for this creative power that peopled our fancies with
such troops of dear and impossible friends.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; comes practically first, and he never
surpassed &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was a poor
story-teller, and in &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; he had no story to
tell; he merely wandered at adventure in that merrier England
which was before railways were.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; is
the last of the stories of the road that begin in the wandering,
aimless, adventurous romances of Greece, or in Petronius Arbiter,
and that live with the life of &ldquo;Gil Blas&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Don Quixote,&rdquo; of &ldquo;Le Roman Comique,&rdquo; of
&ldquo;Tom Jones&rdquo; and &ldquo;Joseph Andrews.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These tales are progresses along highways bristling with
adventure, and among inns full of confusion, Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
affair with the lady with yellow curl-papers being a mild
example.&nbsp; Though &ldquo;Tom Jones&rdquo; has a plot so
excellent, no plot is needed here, and no consecutive story is
required.&nbsp; Detached experiences, vagrants of every rank that
come and go, as in real life, are all the material of the
artist.&nbsp; With such materials Dickens was exactly suited; he
was at home on high-road and lane, street and field-path, in inns
and yeomen&rsquo;s warm hospitable houses.&nbsp; Never a humour
escaped him, and he had such a wealth of fun and high spirits in
these glad days as never any other possessed before.&nbsp; He was
not in the least a bookish man, not in any degree a scholar; but
Nature taught him, and while he wrote with Nature for his
teacher, with men and women for his matter, with diversion for
his aim, he was unsurpassable&mdash;nay, he was
unapproachable.</p>
<p>He could not rest here; he was, after all, a child of an age
that grew sad, and earnest, and thoughtful.&nbsp; He saw abuses
round him&mdash;injustice, and oppression, and cruelty.&nbsp; He
had a heart to which those things were not only abhorrent, but,
as it were, maddening.&nbsp; He knew how great an influence he
wielded, and who can blame him for using it in any cause he
thought good?&nbsp; Very possibly he might have been a greater
artist if he had been less of a man, if he had been quite
disinterested, and had never written &ldquo;with a
purpose.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is common, and even rather obsolete
critical talk.&nbsp; But when we remember that Fielding, too,
very often wrote &ldquo;with a purpose,&rdquo; and that purpose
the protection of the poor and unfriended; and when we remember
what an artist Fielding was, I do not see how we can blame
Dickens.&nbsp; Occasionally he made his art and his purpose blend
so happily that his work was all the better for his benevolent
intentions.&nbsp; We owe Mr. Squeers, Mrs. Squeers, Fanny
Squeers, Wackford and all, to Dickens&rsquo;s indignation against
the nefarious school pirates of his time.&nbsp; If he is less
successful in attacking the Court of Chancery, and very much less
successful still with the Red Tape and Circumlocution Office
affairs, that may be merely because he was less in the humour,
and not because he had a purpose in his mind.&nbsp; Every one of
a man&rsquo;s books cannot be his masterpiece.&nbsp; There is
nothing in literary talk so annoying as the spiteful joy with
which many people declare that an author is &ldquo;worked
out,&rdquo; because his last book is less happy than some that
went before.&nbsp; There came a time in Dickens&rsquo; career
when his works, to my own taste and that of many people, seemed
laboured, artificial&mdash;in fact, more or less failures.&nbsp;
These books range from &ldquo;Dombey and Son,&rdquo; through
&ldquo;Little Dorrit,&rdquo; I dare not say to &ldquo;Our Mutual
Friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; One is afraid that &ldquo;Edwin
Drood,&rdquo; too, suggests the malady which Sir Walter already
detected in his own &ldquo;Peveril of the Peak.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
intense strain on the faculties of Dickens&mdash;as author,
editor, reader, and man of the world&mdash;could not but tell on
him; and years must tell.&nbsp; &ldquo;Philip&rdquo; is not
worthy of the author of &ldquo;Esmond,&rdquo; nor &ldquo;Daniel
Deronda&rdquo; of the author of &ldquo;Silas Marner.&rdquo;&nbsp;
At that time&mdash;the time of the Dorrits and
Dombeys&mdash;<i>Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine</i> published a
&ldquo;Remonstrance with Boz&rdquo;; nor was it quite
superfluous.&nbsp; But Dickens had abundance of talent still to
display&mdash;above all in &ldquo;Great Expectations&rdquo; and
&ldquo;A Tale of Two Cities.&rdquo;&nbsp; The former is, after
&ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; &ldquo;Copperfield,&rdquo; &ldquo;Martin
Chuzzlewit,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nicholas
Nickleby&rdquo;&mdash;after the classics, in fact&mdash;the most
delightful of Dickens&rsquo;s books.&nbsp; The story is
embroiled, no doubt.&nbsp; What are we to think of Estelle?&nbsp;
Has the minx any purpose?&nbsp; Is she a kind of Ethel Newcome of
odd life?&nbsp; It is not easy to say; still, for a story of
Dickens&rsquo;s the plot is comparatively clear and
intelligible.&nbsp; For a study of a child&rsquo;s life, of the
nature Dickens drew best&mdash;the river and the
marshes&mdash;and for plenty of honest explosive fun, there is no
later book of Dickens&rsquo;s like &ldquo;Great
Expectations.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Havisham, too, in her mouldy
bridal splendour, is really impressive; not like Ralph Nickleby
and Monk in &ldquo;Oliver Twist&rdquo;&mdash;a book of which the
plot remains to me a mystery. <a name="citation128"></a><a
href="#footnote128" class="citation">[128]</a>&nbsp; Pip and
Pumblechook and Mr. Wopsle and Jo are all immortal, and cause
laughter inextinguishable.&nbsp; The rarity of this book, by the
way, in its first edition&mdash;the usual library three
volumes&mdash;is rather difficult to explain.&nbsp; One very
seldom sees it come into the market, and then it is highly
priced.</p>
<p>I have mentioned more than once the obscurity of
Dickens&rsquo;s plots.&nbsp; This difficulty may be accounted for
in a very flattering manner.&nbsp; Where do we lose
ourselves?&nbsp; Not in the bare high-road, but among lanes,
between hedges hung with roses, blackberries, morning glories,
where all about us is so full of pleasure that our attention is
distracted and we miss our way.&nbsp; Now, in Dickens&mdash;in
&ldquo;Oliver Twist,&rdquo; in &ldquo;Martin Chuzzlewit,&rdquo;
in &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby&rdquo;&mdash;there is, as in the
lanes, so much to divert and beguile, that we cease to care very
much where the road leads&mdash;a road so full of happy
marvels.&nbsp; The dark, plotting villains&mdash;like the tramp
who frightened Sir Walter Scott so terribly, as he came from Miss
Baillie&rsquo;s at Hampstead&mdash;peer out from behind the
hedges now and then.&nbsp; But we are too much amused by the
light hearts that go all the way, by the Dodger and Crummles and
Mrs. Gamp, to care much for what Ralph, and Monk, and Jonas
Chuzzlewit are plotting.&nbsp; It may not be that the plot is so
confused, but that we are too much diverted to care for the plot,
for the incredible machinations of Uriah Heap, to choose another
example.&nbsp; Mr. Micawber cleared these up; but it is Mr.
Micawber that hinders us from heeding them.</p>
<p>This, at least, is a not unfriendly explanation.&nbsp; Yet I
cannot but believe that, though Dickens took great pains with his
plots, he was not a great plotter.&nbsp; He was not, any more
than Thackeray, a story-teller first and foremost.&nbsp; We can
hold in our minds every thread of Mr. Wilkie Collins&rsquo; web,
or of M. Fortun&eacute; du Boisgobey&rsquo;s, or of M.
Gaboriau&rsquo;s&mdash;all great weavers of intrigues.&nbsp; But
Dickens goes about darkening his intrigue, giving it an extra
knot, an extra twist, hinting here, ominously laughing there,
till we get mystified and bored, and give ourselves up to the fun
of the humours, indifferent to the destinies of villains and
victims.&nbsp; Look at &ldquo;Edwin Drood.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
constant war about the plot rages in the magazines.&nbsp; I
believe, for one, that Edwin Drood was resuscitated; but it gives
me no pleasure.&nbsp; He was too uninteresting.&nbsp;
Dickens&rsquo;s hints, nods, mutterings, forebodings, do not at
all impress one like that deepening and darkening of the awful
omens in &ldquo;The Bride of Lammermoor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here
Scott&mdash;unconsciously, no doubt&mdash;used the very manner of
Homer in the Odyssey, and nowhere was his genius more
Homeric.&nbsp; That was romance.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Tale of Two Cities&rdquo; is a great test of the
faith&mdash;that is in Dickensites.&nbsp; Of all his works it is
the favourite with the wrong sort!&nbsp; Ladies prefer it.&nbsp;
Many people can read it who cannot otherwise read Dickens at
all.&nbsp; This in itself proves that it is not a good example of
Dickens, that it is not central, that it is an outlying province
which he conquered.&nbsp; It is not a favourite of mine.&nbsp;
The humour of the humorous characters rings false&mdash;for
example, the fun of the resurrection-man with the wife who
&ldquo;flops.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Sidney Carton has drawn many tears
down cheeks not accustomed to what Mr. B. in &ldquo;Pamela&rdquo;
calls &ldquo;pearly fugitives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It sometimes strikes one that certain weaknesses in our great
novelists, in Thackeray as well as Dickens, were caused by their
method of publication.&nbsp; The green and yellow leaves
flourished on the trees for two whole years.&nbsp; Who (except
Alexandre the Great) could write so much, and yet all good?&nbsp;
Do we not all feel that &ldquo;David Copperfield&rdquo; should
have been compressed?&nbsp; As to &ldquo;Pendennis,&rdquo; Mr.
Thackeray&rsquo;s bad health when he wrote it might well cause a
certain languor in the later pages.&nbsp; Moreover, he frankly
did not care for the story, and bluffly says, in the preface,
that he respited Colonel Altamont almost at the foot of the
gallows.&nbsp; Dickens took himself more in earnest, and, having
so many pages to fill, conscientiously made Uriah Heap wind and
wriggle through them all.</p>
<p>To try to see blots in the sun, and to pick holes in Dickens,
seems ungrateful, and is indeed an ungrateful task; to no mortal
man have more people owed mirth, pleasure, forgetfulness of care,
knowledge of life in strange places.&nbsp; There never was such
another as Charles Dickens, nor shall we see his like sooner than
the like of Shakespeare.&nbsp; And he owed all to native genius
and hard work; he owed almost nothing to literature, and that
little we regret.&nbsp; He was influenced by Carlyle, he adopted
his method of nicknames, and of hammering with wearisome
iteration on some peculiarity&mdash;for example, on
Carker&rsquo;s teeth, and the patriarch&rsquo;s white hair.&nbsp;
By the way, how incredible is all the Carker episode in
&ldquo;Dombey&rdquo;!&nbsp; Surely Dickens can never have
intended Edith, from the first, to behave as she did!&nbsp;
People may have influenced him, as they influenced Scott about
&ldquo;St. Ronan&rsquo;s Well.&rdquo;&nbsp; It has been said
that, save for Carlyle, Dickens was in letters a self-taught
artist, that he was no man&rsquo;s pupil, and borrowed from
none.&nbsp; No doubt this makes him less acceptable to the
literary class than a man of letters, like Thackeray&mdash;than a
man in whose treasure chamber of memory all the wealth of the
Middle Ages was stored, like Scott.&nbsp; But the native naked
genius of Dickens,&mdash;his heart, his mirth, his observation,
his delightful high spirits, his intrepid loathing of wrong, his
chivalrous desire to right it,&mdash;these things will make him
for ever, we hope and believe, the darling of the English
people.</p>
<h2>ADVENTURES OF BUCCANEERS</h2>
<p>Most of us, as boys, have envied the buccaneers.&nbsp; The
greatest of all boys, Canon Kingsley, once wrote a pleasing and
regretful poem in which the Last Buccaneer represents himself as
a kind of picturesque philanthropist:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There were forty craft in Aves that were
both swift and stout,<br />
All furnished well with small arms, and cannons round about;<br
/>
And a thousand men in Aves made laws so fair and free,<br />
To choose their valiant captains and obey them loyally.<br />
Thence we sailed against the Spaniard with his hoards of plate
and gold,<br />
Which he wrung with cruel tortures from Indian folk of old;<br />
Likewise the merchant captains, with hearts as hard as stone,<br
/>
Who flog men and keel-haul them, and starve them to the
bone.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The buccaneer is &ldquo;a gallant sailor,&rdquo; according to
Kingsley&rsquo;s poem&mdash;a Robin Hood of the waters, who preys
only on the wicked rich, or the cruel and Popish Spaniard, and
the extortionate shipowner.&nbsp; For his own part, when he is
not rescuing poor Indians, the buccaneer lives mainly &ldquo;for
climate and the affections&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, sweet it was in Aves to hear the
landward breeze,<br />
A swing with good tobacco in a net between the trees,<br />
With a negro lass to fan you, while you listened to the roar<br
/>
Of the breakers on the reef outside that never touched the
shore.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is delightfully idyllic, like the lives of the Tahitian
shepherds in the Anti-Jacobin&mdash;the shepherds whose
occupation was a sinecure, as there were no sheep in Tahiti.</p>
<p>Yet the vocation was not really so touchingly chivalrous as
the poet would have us deem.&nbsp; One Joseph Esquemeling,
himself a buccaneer, has written the history and described the
exploits of his companions in plain prose, warning eager youths
that &ldquo;pieces-of-eight do not grow on every tree,&rdquo; as
many raw recruits have believed.&nbsp; Mr. Esquemeling&rsquo;s
account of these matters may be purchased, with a great deal else
that is instructive and entertaining, in &ldquo;The History of
the Buccaneers in America.&rdquo;&nbsp; My edition (of 1810) is a
dumpy little book, in very small type, and quite a crowd of
publishers took part in the venture.&nbsp; The older editions are
difficult to procure if your pockets are not stuffed with
pieces-of-eight.&nbsp; You do not often find even this volume,
but &ldquo;when found make a note of,&rdquo; and you have a reply
to Canon Kingsley.</p>
<p>A charitable old Scotch lady, who heard our ghostly foe evil
spoken of, remarked that, &ldquo;If we were all as diligent and
conscientious as the Devil, it would be better for
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, the buccaneers were certainly models of
diligence and conscientiousness in their own industry, which was
to torture people till they gave up their goods, and then to run
them through the body, and spend the spoils over drink and
dice.&nbsp; Except Dampier, who was a clever man, but a poor
buccaneer (Mr. Clark Russell has written his life), they were the
most hideously ruthless miscreants that ever disgraced the earth
and the sea.&nbsp; But their courage and endurance were no less
notable than their greed and cruelty, so that a moral can be
squeezed even out of these abandoned miscreants.&nbsp; The
soldiers and sailors who made their way within gunshot of
Khartoum, overcoming thirst, hunger, heat, the desert, and the
gallant children of the desert, did not fight, march, and suffer
more bravely than the scoundrels who sacked Mairaibo and burned
Panama.&nbsp; Their good qualities were no less astounding and
exemplary than their almost incredible wickedness.&nbsp; They did
not lie about in hammocks much, listening to the landward wind
among the woods&mdash;the true buccaneers.&nbsp; To tell the
truth, most of them had no particular cause to love the human
species.&nbsp; They were often Europeans who had been sold into
slavery on the West Indian plantations, where they learned
lessons of cruelty by suffering it.&nbsp; Thus Mr. Joseph
Esquemeling, our historian, was beaten, tortured, and nearly
starved to death in Tortuga, &ldquo;so I determined, not knowing
how to get any living, to enter into the order of the pirates or
robbers of the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poor Indians of the isles,
much pitied by Kingsley&rsquo;s buccaneer, had a habit of
sticking their prisoners all over with thorns, wrapped in oily
cotton, whereto they then set fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;These cruelties
many Christians have seen while they lived among these
barbarians.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Esquemeling was to see, and inflict,
plenty of this kind of torment, which was not out of the way nor
unusual.&nbsp; One planter alone had killed over a hundred of his
servants&mdash;&ldquo;the English did the same with
theirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A buccaneer voyage began in stealing a ship, collecting
desperadoes, and torturing the local herdsmen till they gave up
their masters&rsquo; flocks, which were salted as
provisions.&nbsp; Articles of service were then drawn up, on the
principle &ldquo;no prey, no pay.&rdquo;&nbsp; The spoils, when
taken, were loyally divided as a rule, though Captain Morgan, of
Wales, made no more scruple about robbing his crew than about
barbecuing a Spanish priest.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are very civil and
charitable to each other, so that if any one wants what another
has, with great willingness they give it to one
another.&rdquo;&nbsp; In other matters they did not in the least
resemble the early Christians.&nbsp; A fellow nick-named The
Portuguese may be taken as our first example of their commendable
qualities.</p>
<p>With a small ship of four guns he had taken a great one of
twenty guns, with 70,000 pieces-of-eight . . . He himself,
however, was presently captured by a larger vessel, and
imprisoned on board.&nbsp; Being carelessly watched, he escaped
on two earthen jars (for he could not swim), reached the woods in
Campechy, and walked for a hundred and twenty miles through the
bush.&nbsp; His only food was a few shell-fish, and by way of a
knife he had a large nail, which he whetted to an edge on a
stone.&nbsp; Having made a kind of raft, he struck a river, and
paddled to Golpho Triste, where he found congenial pirates.&nbsp;
With twenty of these, and a boat, he returned to Campechy, where
he had been a prisoner, and actually captured the large ship in
which he had lain captive!&nbsp; Bad luck pursued him, however:
his prize was lost in a storm; he reached Jamaica in a canoe, and
never afterwards was concerned as leader in any affair of
distinction.&nbsp; Not even Odysseus had more resource, nor was
more long-enduring; but Fortune was The Portuguese&rsquo;s
foe.</p>
<p>Braziliano, another buccaneer, served as a pirate before the
mast, and &ldquo;was beloved and respected by all.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Being raised to command, he took a plate ship; but this success
was of indifferent service to his otherwise amiable
character.&nbsp; &ldquo;He would often appear foolish and brutish
when in drink,&rdquo; and has been known to roast Spaniards alive
on wooden spits &ldquo;for not showing him hog yards where he
might steal swine.&rdquo;&nbsp; One can hardly suppose that
Kingsley would have regretted <i>this</i> buccaneer, even if he
had been the last, which unluckily he was not.&nbsp; His habit of
sitting in the street beside a barrel of beer, and shooting all
passers-by who would not drink with him, provoked remark, and was
an act detestable to all friends of temperance principles.</p>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois L&rsquo;Olonnois, from southern France, had
been kidnapped, and sold as a slave in the Caribbee
Islands.&nbsp; Recovering his freedom, he plundered the Spanish,
says my buccaneer author, &ldquo;till his unfortunate
death.&rdquo;&nbsp; With two canoes he captured a ship which had
been sent after him, carrying ten guns and a hangman for his
express benefit.&nbsp; This hangman, much to the fellow&rsquo;s
chagrin, L&rsquo;Olonnois put to death like the rest of his
prisoners.&nbsp; His great achievements were in the Gulf of
Venezuela or Bay of Maracaibo.&nbsp; The gulf is a strong place;
the mouth, no wider than a gun-shot, is guarded by two
islands.&nbsp; Far up the inlet is Maracaibo, a town of three
thousand people, fortified and surrounded by woods.&nbsp; Yet
farther up is the town of Gibraltar.&nbsp; To attack these was a
desperate enterprise; but L&rsquo;Olonnois stole past the forts,
and frightened the townsfolk into the woods.&nbsp; As a rule the
Spaniards made the poorest resistance; there were examples of
courage, but none of conduct.&nbsp; With strong forts, heavy
guns, many men, provisions, and ammunition, they quailed before
the desperate valour of the pirates.&nbsp; The towns were sacked,
the fugitives hunted out in the woods, and the most abominable
tortures were applied to make them betray their friends and
reveal their treasures.&nbsp; When they were silent, or had no
treasures to declare, they were hacked, twisted, burned, and
starved to death.</p>
<p>Such were the manners of L&rsquo;Olonnois; and Captain Morgan,
of Wales, was even more ruthless.</p>
<p>Gibraltar was well fortified and strengthened after Maracaibo
fell; new batteries were raised, the way through the woods was
barricaded, and no fewer than eight hundred men were under arms
to resist a small pirate force, exhausted by debauch, and having
its retreat cut off by the forts at the mouth of the great
salt-water loch.&nbsp; But L&rsquo;Olonnois did not blench: he
told the men that audacity was their one hope, also that he would
pistol the first who gave ground.&nbsp; The men cheered
enthusiastically, and a party of three hundred and fifty
landed.&nbsp; The barricaded way they could not force, and in a
newly cut path they met a strong battery which fired grape.&nbsp;
But L&rsquo;Olonnois was invincible.&nbsp; He tried that old
trick which rarely fails, a sham retreat, and this lured the
Spaniards from their earthwork on the path.&nbsp; The pirates
then turned, sword in hand, slew two hundred of the enemy, and
captured eight guns.&nbsp; The town yielded, the people fled to
the woods, and then began the wonted sport of torturing the
prisoners.&nbsp; Maracaibo they ransomed afresh, obtained a
pilot, passed the forts with ease, and returned after sacking a
small province.&nbsp; On a dividend being declared, they parted
260,000 pieces-of-eight among the band, and spent the pillage in
a revel of three weeks.</p>
<p>L&rsquo;Olonnois &ldquo;got great repute&rdquo; by this
conduct, but I rejoice to add that in a raid on Nicaragua he
&ldquo;miserably perished,&rdquo; and met what Mr. Esquemeling
calls &ldquo;his unfortunate death.&rdquo;&nbsp; For
L&rsquo;Olonnois was really an ungentlemanly character.&nbsp; He
would hack a Spaniard to pieces, tear out his heart, and
&ldquo;gnaw it with his teeth like a ravenous wolf, saying to the
rest, &lsquo;I will serve you all alike if you show me not
another way&rsquo;&rdquo; (to a town which he designed
attacking).&nbsp; In Nicaragua he was taken by the Indians, who,
being entirely on the Spanish side, tore him to pieces and burned
him.&nbsp; Thus we really must not be deluded by the professions
of Mr. Kingsley&rsquo;s sentimental buccaneer, with his pity for
&ldquo;the Indian folk of old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Except Denis Scott, a worthy bandit in his day, Captain Henry
Morgan is the first renowned British buccaneer.&nbsp; He was a
young Welshman, who, after having been sold as a slave in
Barbadoes, became a sailor of fortune.&nbsp; With about four
hundred men he assailed Puerto Bello.&nbsp; &ldquo;If our number
is small,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;our hearts are great,&rdquo; and
so he assailed the third city and place of arms which Spain then
possessed in the West Indies.&nbsp; The entrance of the harbour
was protected by two strong castles, judged as &ldquo;almost
impregnable,&rdquo; while Morgan had no artillery of any avail
against fortresses.&nbsp; Morgan had the luck to capture a
Spanish soldier, whom he compelled to parley with the garrison of
the castle.&nbsp; This he stormed and blew up, massacring all its
defenders, while with its guns he disarmed the sister
fortress.&nbsp; When all but defeated in a new assault, the sight
of the English colours animated him afresh.&nbsp; He made the
captive monks and nuns carry the scaling ladders; in this
unwonted exploit the poor religious folk lost many of their
numbers.&nbsp; The wall was mounted, the soldiers were defeated,
though the Governor fought like a Spaniard of the old school,
slew many pirates with his own hand, and pistolled some of his
own men for cowardice.&nbsp; He died at his post, refusing
quarter, and falling like a gentleman of Spain.&nbsp; Morgan,
too, was not wanting in fortitude: he extorted 100,000
pieces-of-eight from the Governor of Panama, and sent him a
pistol as a sample of the gun wherewith he took so great a
city.&nbsp; He added that he would return and take this pistol
out of Panama; nor was he less good than his word.&nbsp; In Cuba
he divided 250,000 pieces-of-eight, and a great booty in other
treasure.&nbsp; A few weeks saw it all in the hands of the
tavern-keepers and women of the place.</p>
<p>Morgan&rsquo;s next performance was a new sack of Maracaibo,
now much stronger than L&rsquo;Olonnois had found it.&nbsp; After
the most appalling cruelties, not fit to be told, he returned,
passing the castles at the mouth of the port by an ingenious
stratagem.&nbsp; Running boatload after boatload of men to the
land side, he brought them back by stealth, leading the garrison
to expect an attack from that quarter.&nbsp; The guns were massed
to landward, and no sooner was this done than Morgan sailed up
through the channel with but little loss.&nbsp; Why the Spaniards
did not close the passage with a boom does not appear.&nbsp;
Probably they were glad to be quit of Morgan on any terms.</p>
<p>A great Spanish fleet he routed by the ingenious employment of
a fire-ship.&nbsp; In a later expedition a strong place was taken
by a curious accident.&nbsp; One of the buccaneers was shot
through the body with an arrow.&nbsp; He drew it out, wrapped it
in cotton, fired it from his musket, and so set light to a roof
and burned the town.</p>
<p>His raid on Panama was extraordinary for the endurance of his
men.&nbsp; For days they lived on the leather of bottles and
belts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some, who were never out of their
mothers&rsquo; kitchens, may ask how these pirates could eat and
digest these pieces of leather, so hard and dry?&nbsp; Whom I
answer&mdash;that could they once experience what hunger, or
rather famine is, they would find the way, as the pirates
did.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was at the close of this march that the
Indians drove wild bulls among them; but they cared very little
for these new allies of the Spaniards: beef, in any form, was
only too welcome.</p>
<p>Morgan burned the fair cedar houses of Panama, but lost the
plate ship with all the gold and silver out of the
churches.&nbsp; How he tortured a poor wretch who chanced to wear
a pair of taffety trousers belonging to his master, with a small
silver key hanging out, it is better not to repeat.&nbsp; The men
only got two hundred pieces-of-eight each, after all their toil,
for their Welshman was indeed a thief, and bilked his crews, no
less than he plundered the Spaniards, without remorse.&nbsp;
Finally, he sneaked away from the fleet with a ship or two; and
it is to be feared that Captain Morgan made rather a good thing
by dint of his incredible cruelty and villainy.</p>
<p>And so we leave Mr. Esquemeling, whom Captain Morgan also
deserted; for who would linger long when there is not even honour
among thieves?&nbsp; Alluring as the pirate&rsquo;s profession
is, we must not forget that it had a seamy side, and was by no
means all rum and pieces-of-eight.&nbsp; And there is something
repulsive to a generous nature in roasting men because they will
not show you where to steal hogs.</p>
<h2>THE SAGAS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The general reader,&rdquo; says a frank critic,
&ldquo;hates the very name of a Saga.&rdquo;&nbsp; The general
reader, in that case, is to be pitied, and, if possible,
converted.&nbsp; But, just as Pascal admits that the sceptic can
only become religious by living as if he <i>were</i>
religious&mdash;by stupefying himself, as Pascal plainly puts it,
with holy water&mdash;so it is to be feared that there is but a
single way of winning over the general reader to the Sagas.&nbsp;
Preaching and example, as in this brief essay, will not avail
with him.&nbsp; He must take Pascal&rsquo;s advice, and live for
an hour or two as if he were a lover of Sagas.&nbsp; He must, in
brief, give that old literature a fair chance.&nbsp; He has now
his opportunity: Mr. William Morris and Mr. Eirikr Magnusson are
publishing a series of cheap translations&mdash;cheap only in
coin of the realm&mdash;a <i>Saga Library</i>.&nbsp; If a general
reader tries the first tale in the first volume, story of
&ldquo;Howard the Halt,&rdquo;&mdash;if he tries it honestly, and
still can make no way with it, then let him take comfort in the
doctrine of Invincible Ignorance.&nbsp; Let him go back to his
favourite literature of gossiping reminiscence, or of realistic
novels.&nbsp; We have all, probably, a drop of the
Northmen&rsquo;s blood in us, but in that general reader the
blood is dormant.</p>
<p>What is a Saga?&nbsp; It is neither quite a piece of history
nor wholly a romance.&nbsp; It is a very old story of things and
adventures that really happened, but happened so long ago, and in
times so superstitious, that marvels and miracles found their way
into the legend.&nbsp; The best Sagas are those of Iceland, and
those, in translations, are the finest reading that the natural
man can desire.&nbsp; If you want true pictures of life and
character, which are always the same at bottom, or true pictures
of manners, which are always changing, and of strange customs and
lost beliefs, in the Sagas they are to be found.&nbsp; Or if you
like tales of enterprise, of fighting by land and sea, fighting
with men and beasts, with storms and ghosts and fiends, the Sagas
are full of this entertainment.</p>
<p>The stories of which we are speaking were first told in
Iceland, perhaps from 950 to 1100 B.C.&nbsp; When Norway and
Sweden were still heathen, a thousand years ago, they were
possessed by families of noble birth, owning no master, and often
at war with each other, when the men were not sailing the seas,
to rob and kill in Scotland, England, France, Italy, and away
east as far as Constantinople, or farther.&nbsp; Though they were
wild sea robbers and warriors, they were sturdy farmers, great
shipbuilders; every man of them, however wealthy, could be his
own carpenter, smith, shipwright, and ploughman.&nbsp; They
forged their own good short swords, hammered their own armour,
ploughed their own fields.&nbsp; In short, they lived like
Odysseus, the hero of Homer, and were equally skilled in the arts
of war and peace.&nbsp; They were mighty lawyers, too, and had a
most curious and minute system of laws on all
subjects&mdash;land, marriage, murder, trade, and so forth.&nbsp;
These laws were not written, though the people had a kind of
letters called runes.&nbsp; But they did not use them much for
documents, but merely for carving a name on a sword-blade, or a
tombstone, or on great gold rings such as they wore on their
arms.&nbsp; Thus the laws existed in the memory and judgment of
the oldest and wisest and most righteous men of the
country.&nbsp; The most important was the law of murder.&nbsp; If
one man slew another, he was not tried by a jury, but any
relation of the dead killed him &ldquo;at sight,&rdquo; wherever
he found him.&nbsp; Even in an Earl&rsquo;s hall, Kari struck the
head off one of his friend Njal&rsquo;s Burners, and the head
bounded on the board, among the trenchers of meat and the cups of
mead or ale.&nbsp; But it was possible, if the relations of a
slain man consented, for the slayer to pay his price&mdash;every
man was valued at so much&mdash;and then revenge was not
taken.&nbsp; But, as a rule, one revenge called for
another.&nbsp; Say Hrut slew Hrap, then Atli slew Hrut, and Gisli
slew Atli, and Kari slew Gisli, and so on till perhaps two whole
families were extinct and there was peace.&nbsp; The gods were
not offended by manslaughter openly done, but were angry with
treachery, cowardice, meanness, theft, perjury, and every kind of
shabbiness.</p>
<p>This was the state of affairs in Norway when a king arose,
Harold Fair-Hair, who tried to bring all these proud people under
him, and to make them pay taxes and live more regularly and
quietly.&nbsp; They revolted at this, and when they were too weak
to defy the king they set sail and fled to Iceland.&nbsp; There
in the lonely north, between the snow and fire, the hot-water
springs, the volcano of Hecla, the great rivers full of salmon
that rush down such falls as Golden Foot, there they lived their
old-fashioned life, cruising as pirates and merchants, taking
foreign service at Mickle Garth, or in England or Egypt, filling
the world with the sound of their swords and the sky with the
smoke of their burnings.&nbsp; For they feared neither God nor
man nor ghost, and were no less cruel than brave; the best of
soldiers, laughing at death and torture, like the Zulus, who are
a kind of black Vikings of Africa.&nbsp; On some of them
&ldquo;Bersark&rsquo;s gang&rdquo; would fall&mdash;that is, they
would become in a way mad, slaying all and sundry, biting their
shields, and possessed with a furious strength beyond that of
men, which left them as weak as children when it passed
away.&nbsp; These Bersarks were outlaws, all men&rsquo;s enemies,
and to kill them was reckoned a great adventure, and a good
deed.&nbsp; The women were worthy of the men&mdash;bold,
quarrelsome, revengeful.&nbsp; Some were loyal, like Bergthora,
who foresaw how all her sons and her husband were to be burned;
but who would not leave them, and perished in the burning without
a cry.&nbsp; Some were as brave as Howard&rsquo;s wife, who
enabled her husband, old and childless, to overthrow the wealthy
bully, the slayer of his only son.&nbsp; Some were treacherous,
as Halgerda the Fair.&nbsp; Three husbands she had, and was the
death of every man of them.&nbsp; Her last lord was Gunnar of
Lithend, the bravest and most peaceful of men.&nbsp; Once she did
a mean thing, and he slapped her face.&nbsp; She never forgave
him.&nbsp; At last enemies besieged him in his house.&nbsp; The
doors were locked&mdash;all was quiet within.&nbsp; One of the
enemies climbed up to a window slit, and Gunnar thrust him
through with his lance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is Gunnar at home?&rdquo;
said the besiegers.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know not&mdash;but his lance
is,&rdquo; said the wounded man, and died with that last jest on
his lips.&nbsp; For long Gunnar kept them at bay with his arrows,
but at last one of them cut the arrow string.&nbsp; &ldquo;Twist
me a string with thy hair,&rdquo; he said to his wife, Halgerda,
whose yellow hair was very long and beautiful.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it
a matter of thy life or death?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I remember that blow
thou gavest me, and I will see thy death.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Gunnar
died, overcome by numbers, and they killed Samr, his hound, but
not before Samr had killed a man.</p>
<p>So they lived always with sword or axe in hand&mdash;so they
lived, and fought, and died.</p>
<p>Then Christianity was brought to them from Norway by
Thangbrand, and if any man said he did not believe a word of it,
Thangbrand had the schoolboy argument, &ldquo;Will you
fight?&rdquo;&nbsp; So they fought a duel on a <i>holm</i> or
island, that nobody might interfere&mdash;holm-gang they called
it&mdash;and Thangbrand usually killed his man.&nbsp; In Norway,
Saint Olaf did the like, killing and torturing those who held by
the old gods&mdash;Thor, Odin, and Freya, and the rest.&nbsp; So,
partly by force and partly because they were somewhat tired of
bloodshed, horsefights, and the rest, they received the word of
the white Christ and were baptised, and lived by written law, and
did not avenge themselves by their own hands.</p>
<p>They were Christians now, but they did not forget the old
times, the old feuds and fightings and Bersarks, and dealings
with ghosts, and with dead bodies that arose and wrought horrible
things, haunting houses and strangling men.&nbsp; The Icelandic
ghosts were able-bodied, well &ldquo;materialised,&rdquo; and
Grettir and Olaf Howard&rsquo;s son fought them with strength of
arm and edge of steel.&nbsp; <i>True</i> stories of the ancient
days were told at the fireside in the endless winter nights by
story tellers or Scalds.&nbsp; It was thought a sin for any one
to alter these old stories, but as generations passed more and
more wonderful matters came into the legend.&nbsp; It was
believed that the dead Gunnar, the famed archer, sang within his
cairn or &ldquo;Howe,&rdquo; the mound wherein he was buried, and
his famous bill or cutting spear was said to have been made by
magic, and to sing in the night before the wounding of men and
the waking of war.&nbsp; People were thought to be
&ldquo;second-sighted&rdquo;&mdash;that is, to have prophetic
vision.&nbsp; The night when Njal&rsquo;s house was burned his
wife saw all the meat on the table &ldquo;one gore of
blood,&rdquo; just as in Homer the prophet Theoclymenus beheld
blood falling in gouts from the walls, before the slaying of the
Wooers.&nbsp; The Valkyries, the Choosers of the slain, and the
Norns who wove the fates of men at a ghastly loom were seen by
living eyes.&nbsp; In the graves where treasures were hoarded the
Barrowwights dwelt, ghosts that were sentinels over the gold:
witchwives changed themselves into wolves and other monstrous
animals, and for many weeks the heroes Signy and Sinfjotli ran
wild in the guise of wolves.</p>
<p>These and many other marvels crept into the Sagas, and made
the listeners feel a shudder of cold beside the great fire that
burned in the centre of the skali or hall where the chief sat,
giving meat and drink to all who came, where the women span and
the Saga man told the tales of long ago.&nbsp; Finally, at the
end of the middle ages, these Sagas were written down in
Icelandic, and in Latin occasionally, and many of them have been
translated into English.</p>
<p>Unluckily, these translations have hitherto been expensive to
buy, and were not always to be had easily.&nbsp; For the wise
world, which reads newspapers all day and half the night, does
not care much for books, still less for good books, least of all
for old books.&nbsp; You can make no money out of reading Sagas:
they have nothing to say about stocks and shares, nor about Prime
Ministers and politics.&nbsp; Nor will they amuse a man, if
nothing amuses him but accounts of races and murders, or gossip
about Mrs. Nokes&rsquo;s new novel, Mrs. Stokes&rsquo;s new
dresses, or Lady Jones&rsquo;s diamonds.&nbsp; The Sagas only
tell how brave men&mdash;of our own blood very
likely&mdash;lived, and loved, and fought, and voyaged, and died,
before there was much reading or writing, when they sailed
without steam, travelled without railways, and warred
hand-to-hand, not with hidden dynamite and sunk torpedoes.&nbsp;
But, for stories of gallant life and honest purpose, the Sagas
are among the best in the world.</p>
<p>Of Sagas in English one of the best is the
&ldquo;Volsunga,&rdquo; the story of the Niflungs and
Volsungs.&nbsp; This book, thanks to Mr. William Morris, can be
bought for a shilling.&nbsp; It is a strange tale in which gods
have their parts, the tale of that oldest Treasure Hunt, the Hunt
for the gold of the dwarf Andvari.&nbsp; This was guarded by the
serpent, Fafnir, who had once been a man, and who was killed by
the hero Sigurd.&nbsp; But Andvari had cursed the gold, because
his enemies robbed him of it to the very last ring, and had no
pity.&nbsp; Then the brave Sigurd was involved in the evil
luck.&nbsp; He it was who rode through the fire, and woke the
fair enchanted Brynhild, the Shield-maiden.&nbsp; And she loved
him, and he her, with all their hearts, always to the
death.&nbsp; But by ill fate she was married to another man,
Sigurd&rsquo;s chief friend, and Sigurd to another woman.&nbsp;
And the women fell to jealousy and quarrelling as women will, and
they dragged the friends into the feud, and one manslaying after
another befell, till that great murder of men in the Hall of
Atli, the King.&nbsp; The curse came on one and all of
them&mdash;a curse of blood, and of evil loves, and of witchwork
destroying good and bad, all fearless, and all fallen in one red
ruin.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Volsunga Saga&rdquo; has this unique and
unparalleled interest, that it gives the spectacle of the highest
epic genius, struggling out of savagery into complete and free
and conscious humanity.&nbsp; It is a mark of the savage
intellect not to discriminate abruptly between man and the lower
animals.&nbsp; In the tales of the lower peoples, the characters
are just as often beasts as men and women.&nbsp; Now, in the
earlier and wilder parts of the &ldquo;Volsunga Saga,&rdquo;
otters and dragons play human parts.&nbsp; Signy and his son, and
the mother of their enemy, put on the skins of wolves, become
wolves, and pass through hideous adventures.&nbsp; The story
reeks with blood, and ravins with lust of blood.&nbsp; But when
Sigurd arrives at full years of manhood, the barbarism yields
place, the Saga becomes human and conscious.</p>
<p>These legends deal little with love.&nbsp; But in the
&ldquo;Volsunga Saga&rdquo; the permanent interest is the true
and deathless love of Sigurd and Brynhild: their separation by
magic arts, the revival of their passion too late, the
man&rsquo;s resigned and heroic acquiescence, the fiercer passion
of the woman, who will neither bear her fate nor accept her bliss
at the price of honour and her plighted word.</p>
<p>The situation, the <i>nodus</i>, is neither ancient merely nor
modern merely, but of all time.&nbsp; Sigurd, having at last
discovered the net in which he was trapped, was content to make
the best of marriage and of friendship.&nbsp; Brynhild was
not.&nbsp; &ldquo;The hearts of women are the hearts of
wolves,&rdquo; says the ancient Sanskrit commentary on the Rig
Veda.&nbsp; But the she-wolf&rsquo;s heart broke, like a
woman&rsquo;s, when she had caused Sigurd&rsquo;s slaying.&nbsp;
Both man and woman face life, as they conceive it, with eyes
perfectly clear.</p>
<p>The magic and the supernatural wiles are accidental, the human
heart is essential and eternal.&nbsp; There is no scene like this
in the epics of Greece.&nbsp; This is a passion that Homer did
not dwell upon.&nbsp; In the Iliad and Odyssey the repentance of
Helen is facile; she takes life easily.&nbsp; Clytemnestra is not
brought on the stage to speak for herself.&nbsp; In this respect
the epic of the North, without the charm and the delightfulness
of the Southern epic, excels it; in this and in a certain bare
veracity, but in nothing else.&nbsp; We cannot put the Germanic
legend on the level of the Greek, for variety, for many-sided
wisdom, for changing beauty of a thousand colours.&nbsp; But in
this one passion of love the &ldquo;Volsunga Saga&rdquo; excels
the Iliad.</p>
<p>The Greek and the Northern stories are alike in one
thing.&nbsp; Fate is all-powerful over gods and men.&nbsp; Odin
cannot save Balder; nor Thetis, Achilles; nor Zeus,
Sarpedon.&nbsp; But in the Sagas fate is more constantly present
to the mind.&nbsp; Much is thought of being &ldquo;lucky,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;unlucky.&rdquo;&nbsp; Howard&rsquo;s &ldquo;good
luck&rdquo; is to be read in his face by the wise, even when, to
the common gaze, he seems a half-paralytic dotard, dying of grief
and age.</p>
<p>Fate and evil luck dog the heroes of the Sagas.&nbsp; They
seldom &ldquo;end well,&rdquo; as people say,&mdash;unless, when
a brave man lies down to die on the bed he has strewn of the
bodies of his foes, you call <i>that</i> ending well.&nbsp; So
died Grettir the Strong.&nbsp; Even from a boy he was strong and
passionate, short of temper, quick of stroke, but loyal, brave,
and always unlucky.&nbsp; His worst luck began after he slew
Glam.&nbsp; This Glam was a wicked heathen herdsman, who would
not fast on Christmas Eve.&nbsp; So on the hills his dead body
was found, swollen as great as an ox, and as blue as death.</p>
<p>What killed him they did not know.&nbsp; But he haunted the
farmhouse, riding the roof, kicking the sides with his heels,
killing cattle and destroying all things.&nbsp; Then Grettir came
that way, and he slept in the hall.&nbsp; At night the dead Glam
came in, and Grettir arose, and to it they went, struggling and
dashing the furniture to bits.&nbsp; Glam even dragged Grettir to
the door, that he might slay him under the sky, and for all his
force Grettir yielded ground.&nbsp; Then on the very threshold he
suddenly gave way when Glam was pulling hardest, and they fell,
Glam undermost.&nbsp; Then Grettir drew the short sword,
&ldquo;Kari&rsquo;s loom,&rdquo; that he had taken from a haunted
grave, and stabbed the dead thing that had lived again.&nbsp;
But, as Glam lay a-dying in the second death, the moon fell on
his awful eyes, and Grettir saw the horror of them, and from that
hour he could not endure to be in the dark, and he never dared to
go alone.&nbsp; This was his death, for he had an evil companion
who betrayed him to his enemies; but when they set on Grettir,
though he was tired and sick of a wound, many died with
him.&nbsp; No man died like Grettir the Strong, nor slew so many
in his death.</p>
<p>Besides those Sagas, there is the best of all, but the
longest, &ldquo;Njala&rdquo; (pronounced &ldquo;Nyoula&rdquo;),
the story of Burnt Njal.&nbsp; That is too long to sketch here,
but it tells how, through the hard hearts and jealousy of women,
ruin came at last on the gentle Gunnar, and the reckless
Skarphedin of the axe, &ldquo;The Ogress of War,&rdquo; and how
Njal, the wisest, the most peaceful, the most righteous of men,
was burned with all his house, and how that evil deed was avenged
on the Burners of Kari.</p>
<p>The site of Njal&rsquo;s house is yet to be seen, after these
nine hundred years, and the little glen where Kari hid when he
leaped through the smoke and the flame that made his sword-blade
blue.&nbsp; Yes, the very black sand that Bergthora and her maids
threw on the fire lies there yet, and remnants of the whey they
cast on the flames, when water failed them.&nbsp; They were still
there beneath the earth when an English traveller dug up some of
the ground last year, and it is said that an American gentleman
found a gold ring in the house of Njal.&nbsp; The story of him
and of his brave sons, and of his slaves, and of his kindred, and
of Queens and Kings of Norway, and of the coming of the white
Christ, are all in the &ldquo;Njala.&rdquo;&nbsp; That and the
other Sagas would bear being shortened for general readers; once
they were all that the people had by way of books, and they liked
them long.&nbsp; But, shortened or not, they are brave books for
men, for the world is a place of battle still, and life is
war.&nbsp; These old heroes knew it, and did not shirk it, but
fought it out, and left honourable names and a glory that widens
year by year.&nbsp; For the story of Njal and Gunnar and
Skarphedin was told by Captain Speedy to the guards of Theodore,
King of Abyssinia.&nbsp; They liked it well; and with queer
altered names and changes of the tale, that Saga will be told in
Abyssinia, and thence carried all through Africa where white men
have never wandered.&nbsp; So wide, so long-enduring a renown
could be given by a nameless Sagaman.</p>
<h2>CHARLES KINGSLEY</h2>
<p>When I was very young, a distinguished <i>Review</i> was still
younger.&nbsp; I remember reading one of the earliest numbers,
being then myself a boy of ten, and coming on a review of a
novel.&nbsp; Never, as it seemed to me, or seems to my memory,
was a poor novel more heavily handled: and yet I felt that the
book must be a book to read on the very earliest
opportunity.&nbsp; It was &ldquo;Westward Ho!&rdquo; the most
famous, and perhaps the best novel, of Charles Kingsley.&nbsp;
Often one has read it since, and it is an example of those large,
rich, well-fed romances, at which you can cut and come again, as
it were, laying it down, and taking it up on occasion, with the
certainty of being excited, amused&mdash;and preached at.</p>
<p>Lately I have re-read &ldquo;Westward Ho!&rdquo; and some of
Kingsley&rsquo;s other books, &ldquo;Hypatia,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hereward the Wake,&rdquo; and the poems, over again.&nbsp;
The old pleasure in them is not gone indeed, but it is
modified.&nbsp; One must be a boy to think Kingsley a
humourist.&nbsp; At the age of twelve or ten you take the comic
passages which he conscientiously provides, without being vexed
or offended; you take them merely in the way of business.&nbsp;
Better things are coming: struggles with the Inquisition, storms
at sea, duels, the Armada, wanderings in the Lotus land of the
tropical west; and for the sake of all this a boy puts up
good-naturedly with Kingsley&rsquo;s humour.&nbsp; Perhaps he
even grins over Amyas &ldquo;burying alternately his face in the
pasty and the pasty in his face,&rdquo; or he tries to feel
diverted by the Elizabethan waggeries of Frank.&nbsp; But there
is no fun in them&mdash;they are mechanical; they are worse than
the humours of Scott&rsquo;s Sir Percy Shafto, which are not
fine.</p>
<p>The same sense of everything not being quite so excellent as
one remembered it haunts one in &ldquo;Hereward the Wake, the
Last of the English.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kingsley calls him &ldquo;the
Last of the English,&rdquo; but he is really the first of the
literary Vikings.&nbsp; In the essay on the Sagas here I have
tried to show, very imperfectly, what the Norsemen were actually
like.&nbsp; They caught Kingsley&rsquo;s fancy, and his
&ldquo;Hereward,&rdquo; though born on English soil, is really
Norse&mdash;not English.&nbsp; But Kingsley did not write about
the Vikings, nor about his Elizabethan heroes in &ldquo;Westward
Ho!&rdquo; in a perfectly simple, straightforward way.&nbsp; He
was always thinking of our own times and referring to them.&nbsp;
That is why even the rather ruffianly Hereward is so great an
enemy of saints and monks.&nbsp; That is why, in
&ldquo;Hypatia&rdquo; (which opens so well), we have those
prodigiously dull, stupid, pedantic, and conceited reflections of
Raphael Ben Ezra.&nbsp; That is why, in all Kingsley&rsquo;s
novels, he is perpetually exciting himself in defence of marriage
and the family life, as if any monkish ideas about the
blessedness of bachelorhood were ever likely to drive the great
Anglo-Saxon race into convents and monasteries.&nbsp; That is the
very last thing we have to be afraid of; but Kingsley was afraid
of it, and was eternally attacking everything Popish and
monkish.</p>
<p>Boys and young people, then, can read &ldquo;Westward
Ho!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hypatia,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hereward the
Wake,&rdquo; with far more pleasure than their elders.&nbsp; They
hurry on with the adventures, and do not stop to ask what the
moralisings mean.&nbsp; They forgive the humour of Kingsley
because it is well meant.&nbsp; They get, in short, the real good
of this really great and noble and manly and blundering
genius.&nbsp; They take pleasure in his love of strong men,
gallant fights, desperate encounters with human foes, with raging
seas, with pestilence, or in haunted forests.&nbsp; For in all
that is good of his talent&mdash;in his courage, his frank
speech, his love of sport, his clear eyes, his devotion to field
and wood, river, moor, sea, and storms&mdash;Kingsley is a
boy.&nbsp; He has the brave, rather hasty, and not over
well-informed enthusiasm of sixteen, for persons and for
causes.&nbsp; He saw an opponent (it might be Father Newman): his
heart lusted for a fight; he called his opponent names, he threw
his cap into the ring, he took his coat off, he fought, he got a
terrible scientific drubbing.&nbsp; It was like a sixth-form boy
matching himself against the champion.&nbsp; And then he bore no
malice.&nbsp; He took his defeat bravely.&nbsp; Nay, are we not
left with a confused feeling that he was not far in the wrong,
though he had so much the worse of the fight?</p>
<p>Such was Kingsley: a man with a boy&rsquo;s heart; a hater of
cruelty and injustice, and also with a brave, indomitable belief
that his own country and his own cause were generally in the
right, whatever the quarrel.&nbsp; He loved England like a
mistress, and hated her enemies, Spain and the Pope, though even
in them he saw the good.&nbsp; He is for ever scolding the
Spanish for their cruelties to the Indians, but he defends our
doings to the Irish, which (at that time) were neither more nor
less oppressive than the Spanish performances in America.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go it, our side!&rdquo; you always hear this good Kingsley
crying; and one&rsquo;s heart goes out to him for it, in an age
when everybody often proves his own country to be in the
wrong.</p>
<p>Simple, brave, resolute, manly, a little given to
&ldquo;robustiousness,&rdquo; Kingsley transfigured all these
qualities by possessing the soul and the heart of a poet.&nbsp;
He was not a very great poet, indeed, but a true poet&mdash;one
of the very small band who are cut off, by a gulf that can never
be passed, from mere writers of verse, however clever, educated,
melodious, ingenious, amiable, and refined.&nbsp; He had the real
spark of fire, the true note; though the spark might seldom break
into flame, and the note was not always clear.&nbsp; Never let us
confuse true poets with writers of verse, still less with writers
of &ldquo;poetic prose.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kingsley wrote a great deal
of that-perhaps too much: his descriptions of scenes are not
always as good as in Hereward&rsquo;s ride round the Fens, or
when the tall, Spanish galleon staggers from the revenge of man
to the vengeance of God, to her doom through the mist, to her
rest in the sea.&nbsp; Perhaps only a poet could have written
that prose; it is certain no writer of &ldquo;poetic prose&rdquo;
could have written Kingsley&rsquo;s poems.</p>
<p>His songs are his best things; they really are songs, not
merely lyric poems.&nbsp; They have the merit of being truly
popular, whether they are romantic, like &ldquo;The Sands
o&rsquo; Dee,&rdquo; which actually reproduces the best qualities
of the old ballad; or whether they are pathetic, like the
&ldquo;Doll&rsquo;s Song,&rdquo; in &ldquo;Water Babies&rdquo;;
or whether they attack an abuse, as in the song of &ldquo;The
Merry Brown Hares&rdquo;; or whether they soar higher, as in
&ldquo;Deep, deep Love, within thine own abyss abiding&rdquo;; or
whether they are mere noble nonsense, as in &ldquo;Lorraine
Loree&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;She mastered young Vindictive; oh, the
gallant lass was she,<br />
And kept him straight and won the race, as near as near could
be;<br />
But he killed her at the brook against a pollard willow tree;<br
/>
Oh, he killed her at the brook, the brute, for all the world to
see,<br />
And no one but the baby cried for poor Lorraine Loree.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The truth about Charles Kingsley seems to be that he rather
made a brave and cheery noise in this night-battle of modern
life, than that he directed any movement of forces.&nbsp; He kept
cheering, as it were, and waving his sword with a contagious
enthusiasm.&nbsp; Being a poet, and a man both of heart and of
sentiment, he was equally attached to the best things of the old
world and to the best of the new world, as far as one can
forecast what it is to be.&nbsp; He loved the stately homes of
England, the ancient graduated order of society, the sports of
the past, the military triumphs, the patriotic glories.&nbsp; But
he was also on the side of the poor: as &ldquo;Parson Lot&rdquo;
he attempted to be a Christian Socialist.</p>
<p>Now, the Socialists are the people who want to take
everything; the Christians are the persons who do not want to
give more than they find convenient.&nbsp; Kingsley himself was
ready to give, and did give, his time, his labour, his health,
and probably his money, to the poor.&nbsp; But he was by no means
minded that they should swallow up the old England with church
and castle, manor-house and tower, wealth, beauty, learning,
refinement.&nbsp; The man who wrote &ldquo;Alton Locke,&rdquo;
the story of the starved tailor-poet, was the man who nearly wept
when he heard a fox bark, and reflected that the days of
fox-hunting were numbered.&nbsp; He had a poet&rsquo;s politics,
Colonel Newcome&rsquo;s politics.&nbsp; He was for England, for
the poor, for the rich, for the storied houses of the chivalrous
past, for the cottage, for the hall; and was dead against the
ideas of Manchester, and of Mr. John Bright.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
father,&rdquo; he says in a letter, &ldquo;would have put his
hand to a spade or an axe with any man, and so could I pretty
well, too, when I was in my prime; and my eldest son is now
working with his own hands at farming, previous to emigrating to
South America, where he will do the drudgery of his own
cattle-pens and sheepfolds; and if I were twenty-four and
unmarried I would go out there too, and work like an Englishman,
and live by the sweat of my brow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the right side of his love of the Vikings; it was
thus <i>they</i> lived, when not at war&mdash;thus that every
gentleman who has youth and health should work, winning new
worlds for his class, in place of this miserable, over-crowded,
brawling England.&nbsp; This, I think, was, or should have been,
the real lesson and message of Kingsley for the generations to
come.&nbsp; Like Scott the scion of an old knightly line, he had
that drop of wild blood which drives men from town into the air
and the desert, wherever there are savage lands to conquer,
beasts to hunt, and a hardy life to be lived.&nbsp; But he was
the son of a clergyman, and a clergyman himself.&nbsp; The spirit
that should have gone into action went into talking, preaching,
writing&mdash;all sources of great pleasure to thousands of
people, and so not wasted.&nbsp; Yet these were not the natural
outlets of Kingsley&rsquo;s life: he should have been a soldier,
or an explorer; at least, we may believe that he would have
preferred such fortune.&nbsp; He did his best, the best he knew,
and it is all on the side of manliness, courage, kindness.&nbsp;
Perhaps he tried too many things&mdash;science, history, fairy
tales, religious and political discussions, romance,
poetry.&nbsp; Poetry was what he did best, romance next; his
science and his history are entertaining, but without
authority.</p>
<p>This, when one reads it again, seems a cold, unfriendly
estimate of a man so ardent and so genuine, a writer so vivacious
and courageous as Kingsley.&nbsp; Even the elderly reviewer bears
to him, and to his brother Henry, a debt he owes to few of their
generation.&nbsp; The truth is we should <i>read</i> Kingsley; we
must not criticise him.&nbsp; We must accept him and be glad of
him, as we accept a windy, sunny autumn day&mdash;beautiful and
blusterous&mdash;to be enjoyed and struggled with.&nbsp; If once
we stop and reflect, and hesitate, he seems to preach too much,
and with a confidence which his knowledge of the world and of
history does not justify.&nbsp; To be at one with Kingsley we
must be boys again, and that momentary change cannot but be good
for us.&nbsp; Soon enough&mdash;too soon&mdash;we shall drop back
on manhood, and on all the difficulties and dragons that Kingsley
drove away by a blast on his chivalrous and cheery horn.</p>
<h2>CHARLES LEVER: HIS BOOKS, ADVENTURES AND MISFORTUNES</h2>
<p>Surely it is a pleasant thing that there are books, like other
enjoyments, for all ages.&nbsp; You would not have a boy prefer
whist to fives, nor tobacco to toffee, nor Tolsto&iuml; to
Charles Lever.&nbsp; The ancients reckoned Tyrt&aelig;cus a fine
poet, not that he was particularly melodious or reflective, but
that he gave men heart to fight for their country.&nbsp; Charles
Lever has done as much.&nbsp; In his biography, by Mr.
Fitzpatrick, it is told that a widow lady had but one son, and
for him she obtained an appointment at Woolwich.&nbsp; The boy
was timid and nervous, and she fancied that she must find for him
some other profession&mdash;perhaps that of literature.&nbsp; But
he one day chanced on Lever&rsquo;s novels, and they put so much
heart into him that his character quite altered, and he became
the bravest of the brave.</p>
<p>Lever may not do as much for every one, but he does teach
contempt of danger, or rather, delight in it: a gay, spontaneous,
boyish kind of courage&mdash;Irish courage at its best.&nbsp; We
may get more good from that than harm from all his tales of much
punch and many drinking bouts.&nbsp; These are no longer in
fashion and are not very gay reading, perhaps, but his stories
and songs, his duels and battles and hunting scenes are as merry
and as good as ever.&nbsp; Wild as they seem in the reading, they
are not far from the truth, as may be gathered out of
&ldquo;Barrington&rsquo;s Memoirs,&rdquo; and their tales of the
reckless Irish life some eighty years ago.</p>
<p>There were two men in Charles Lever&mdash;a glad man and a sad
man.&nbsp; The gaiety was for his youth, when he poured out his
&ldquo;Lorrequers&rdquo; and &ldquo;O&rsquo;Malleys,&rdquo; all
the mirth and memories of his boyhood, all the tales of fighting
and feasting he gleaned from battered, seasoned old warriors,
like Major Monsoon.&nbsp; Even then, Mr. Thackeray, who knew him,
and liked and laughed at him, recognised through his merriment
&ldquo;the fund of sadness beneath.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
author&rsquo;s character is <i>not</i> humour, but sentiment . .
. extreme delicacy, sweetness and kindliness of heart.&nbsp; The
spirits are mostly artificial, the <i>fond</i> is sadness, as
appears to me to be that of most Irish writing and
people.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in &ldquo;Charles
O&rsquo;Malley,&rdquo; what a true, dark picture that is of the
duel beside the broad, angry river on the level waste under the
wide grey sky!&nbsp; Charles has shot his opponent, Bodkin, and
with Considine, his second, is making his escape.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Considine cried out suddenly, &lsquo;Too infamous, by
Jove: we are murdered men!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that?&rsquo; said he,
pointing to something black which floated from a pole at the
opposite side of the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes; what is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s his coat they&rsquo;ve put upon an
oar, to show the people he&rsquo;s killed&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all.&nbsp; Every man here&rsquo;s his tenant; and look there!
they&rsquo;re not giving us much doubt as to their
intentions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here a tremendous yell burst forth from the mass of
people along the shore, which, rising to a terrific cry, sank
gradually down to a low wailing, then rose and fell several
times, as the Irish death-cry filled the air, and rose to heaven,
as if imploring vengeance on a murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passages like this, and that which follows&mdash;the dangerous
voyage through the storm on the flooded Shannon, and through the
reefs&mdash;are what Mr. Thackeray may have had in his mind when
he spoke of Lever&rsquo;s underlying melancholy.&nbsp; Like other
men with very high spirits, he had hours of gloom, and the
sadness and the thoughtfulness that were in him came forth then
and informed his later books.&nbsp; These are far more carefully
written, far more cunningly constructed, than the old chapters
written from month to month as the fit took him, with no more
plan or premeditation than &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it
is the early stories that we remember, and that he lives
by&mdash;the pages thrown off at a heat, when he was a lively
doctor with few patients, and was not over-attentive to
them.&nbsp; These were the days of Harry Lorrequer and Tom Burke;
characters that ran away with him, and took their own path
through a merry world of diversion.&nbsp; Like the knights in Sir
Thomas Malory, these heroes &ldquo;ride at adventure,&rdquo; ride
amazing horses that dread no leap, be it an Irish stone wall on a
mountain crest, or be it the bayonets of a French square.</p>
<p>Mr. Lever&rsquo;s biographer has not been wholly successful in
pleasing the critics, and he does not seem to affect very
critical airs himself, but he tells a straightforward tale.&nbsp;
The life of Charles Lever is the natural commentary on his
novels.&nbsp; He was born at Dublin in 1806, the son of a builder
or architect.&nbsp; At school he was very much flogged, and the
odds are that he deserved these attentions, for he had high
spirits beyond the patience of dominies.&nbsp; Handsome, merry
and clever, he read novels in school hours, wore a ring, and set
up as a dandy.&nbsp; Even then he was in love with the young lady
whom he married in the end.&nbsp; At a fight with boys of another
school, he and a friend placed a mine under the ground occupied
by the enemy, and blew them, more or less, into the air.&nbsp;
Many an eyebrow was singed off on that fatal day, when, for the
only time, this romancer of the wars &ldquo;smelled
powder.&rdquo;&nbsp; He afterwards pleaded for his party before
the worthy police magistrate, and showed great promise as a
barrister.&nbsp; At Trinity College, Dublin, he was full of his
fun, made ballads, sang them through the streets in disguise
(like Fergusson, the Scottish poet), and one night collected
thirty shillings in coppers.</p>
<p>The original of Frank Webber, in &ldquo;Charles
O&rsquo;Malley,&rdquo; was a chum of his, and he took part in the
wonderful practical jokes which he has made immortal in that
novel.</p>
<p>From Trinity College, Dublin, Lever went to G&ouml;ttingen,
where he found fun and fighting enough among the German
students.&nbsp; From that hour he became a citizen of the world,
or, at least, of Europe, and perhaps, like the prophets, was most
honoured when out of his own country.&nbsp; He returned to Dublin
and took his degree in medicine, after playing a famous practical
joke.&nbsp; A certain medical professor was wont to lecture in
bed.&nbsp; One night he left town unexpectedly.&nbsp; Lever, by
chance, came early to lecture, found the Professor absent,
slipped into his bed, put on his nightcap, and took the class
himself.&nbsp; On another day he was standing outside the
Foundling Hospital with a friend, a small man.&nbsp; Now, a kind
of stone cradle for foundlings was built outside the door, and,
when a baby was placed therein, a bell rang.&nbsp; Lever lifted
up his friend, popped him into the cradle, and had the joy of
seeing the promising infant picked out by the porter.</p>
<p>It seems a queer education for a man of letters; but, like Sir
Walter Scott when revelling in Liddesdale, he &ldquo;was making
himself all the time.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was collecting myriads of
odd experiences and treasures of anecdotes; he was learning to
know men of all sorts; and later, as a country doctor, he had
experiences of mess tables, of hunting, and of all the ways of
his remarkable countrymen.&nbsp; When cholera visited his
district he stuck to his work like a man of heart and
courage.&nbsp; But the usual tasks of a country doctor wearied
him; he neglected them, he became unpopular with the authorities,
he married his first love and returned to Brussels, where he
practised as a physician.&nbsp; He had already begun his first
notable book, &ldquo;Harry Lorrequer,&rdquo; in the <i>University
Magazine</i>.&nbsp; It is merely a string of Irish and other
stories, good, bad, and indifferent&mdash;a picture gallery full
of portraits of priests, soldiers, peasants and odd
characters.&nbsp; The plot is of no importance; we are not
interested in Harry&rsquo;s love affairs, but in his scrapes,
adventures, duels at home and abroad.&nbsp; He fights people by
mistake whom he does not know by sight, he appears on parade with
his face blackened, he wins large piles at <i>trente et
quarante</i>, he disposes of coopers of claret and bowls of
punch, and the sheep on a thousand hills provide him with
devilled kidneys.&nbsp; The critics and the authors thought
little of the merry medley, but the public enjoyed it, and defied
the reviewers.&nbsp; One paper preferred the book to a wilderness
of &ldquo;Pickwicks&rdquo;; and as this opinion was advertised
everywhere by M&rsquo;Glashan, the publisher, Mr. Dickens was
very much annoyed indeed.&nbsp; Authors are easily annoyed.&nbsp;
But Lever writes <i>ut placeat pueris</i>, and there was a
tremendous fight at Rugby between two boys, the &ldquo;Slogger
Williams&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tom Brown&rdquo; of the period, for
the possession of &ldquo;Harry Lorrequer.&rdquo;&nbsp; When an
author has the boys of England on his side, he can laugh at the
critics.&nbsp; Not that Lever laughed: he, too, was easily vexed,
and much depressed, when the reviews assailed him.&nbsp; Next he
began &ldquo;Charles O&rsquo;Malley&rdquo;; and if any man reads
this essay who has not read the &ldquo;Irish Dragoon,&rdquo; let
him begin at once.&nbsp; &ldquo;O&rsquo;Malley&rdquo; is what you
can recommend to a friend.&nbsp; Here is every species of
diversion: duels and steeplechases, practical jokes at college
(good practical jokes, not booby traps and apple-pie beds); here
is fighting in the Peninsula.&nbsp; If any student is in doubt,
let him try chapter xiv.&mdash;the battle on the Douro.&nbsp;
This is, indeed, excellent military writing, and need not fear
comparison as art with Napier&rsquo;s famous history.&nbsp; Lever
has warmed to his work; his heart is in it; he had the best
information from an eye-witness; and the brief beginning, on the
peace of nature before the strife of men, is admirably
poetical.</p>
<p>To reach the French, under Soult, Wellesley had to cross the
deep and rapid Douro, in face of their fire, and without regular
transport.&nbsp; &ldquo;He dared the deed.&nbsp; What must have
been his confidence in the men he commanded! what must have been
his reliance on his own genius!&rdquo;</p>
<p>You hold your breath as you read, while English and Germans
charge, till at last the field is won, and the dust of the French
columns retreating in the distance blows down the road to
Spain.</p>
<p>The Great Duke read this passage, and marvelled how Lever knew
certain things that he tells.&nbsp; He learned this, and much
more, the humours of war, from the original of Major
Monsoon.&nbsp; Falstaff is alone in the literature of the world,
but if ever there came a later Falstaff, Monsoon was the
man.&nbsp; And where have you such an Irish Sancho Panza as Micky
Free, that independent minstrel, or such an Irish Di Vernon as
Baby Blake?&nbsp; The critics may praise Lever&rsquo;s thoughtful
and careful later novels as they will, but &ldquo;Charles
O&rsquo;Malley&rdquo; will always be the pattern of a military
romance.&nbsp; The anecdote of &ldquo;a virtuous weakness&rdquo;
in O&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s character would
alone make the fortune of many a story.&nbsp; The truth is, it is
not easy to lay down &ldquo;Charles O&rsquo;Malley,&rdquo; to
leave off reading it, and get on with the account of Lever.</p>
<p>His excellent and delightful novel scarcely received one
favourable notice from the press.&nbsp; This may have been
because it was so popular; but Lever became so nervous that he
did not like to look at the papers.&nbsp; When he went back to
Dublin and edited a magazine there, he was more fiercely assailed
than ever.&nbsp; It is difficult for an Irishman to write about
the Irish, or for a Scot to write about the Scottish, without
hurting the feelings of his countrymen.&nbsp; While their
literary brethren are alive they are not very dear to the
newspaper scribes of these gallant nations; and thus Jeffrey was
more severe to Scott than he need have been, while the Irish
press, it appears, made an onslaught on Lever.&nbsp; Mr.
Thackeray met Lever in Dublin, and he mentions this unkind
behaviour.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lorrequer&rsquo;s military propensities
have been objected to strongly by his squeamish Hibernian
brethren . . . But is Lorrequer the only man in Ireland who is
fond of military spectacles?&nbsp; Why does the <i>Nation</i>
publish these edifying and Christian war songs? . . . And who is
it that prates about the Irish at Waterloo, and the Irish at
Fontenoy, and the Irish at Seringapatam, and the Irish at
Timbuctoo?&nbsp; If Mr. O&rsquo;Connell, like a wise rhetorician,
chooses, and very properly, to flatter the national military
passion, why not Harry Lorrequer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why not, indeed?&nbsp; But Mr. Lever was a successful Irishman
of letters, and a good many other Irish gentlemen of letters,
honest Doolan and his friends, were not successful.&nbsp; That is
the humour of it.</p>
<p>Though you, my youthful reader, if I have one, do not detest
Jones because he is in the Eleven, nor Brown because he has
&ldquo;got his cap,&rdquo; nor Smith because he does Greek
Iambics like Sophocles; though you rather admire and applaud
these champions, you may feel very differently when you come to
thirty years or more, and see other men doing what you cannot do,
and gaining prizes beyond your grasp.&nbsp; And then, if you are
a reviewer, you &ldquo;will find fault with a book for what it
does not give,&rdquo; as thus, to take Mr. Thackeray&rsquo;s
example:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Smigsmag&rsquo;s novel is amusing, but lamentably
deficient in geological information.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr.
Lever&rsquo;s novels are trashy and worthless, for his facts are
not borne out by any authority, and he gives us no information
about the political state of Ireland.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh! our
country, our green and beloved, our beautiful and
oppressed?&rsquo;&rdquo; and so forth.</p>
<p>It was not altogether a happy time that Lever passed at
home.&nbsp; Not only did his native critics belabour him most
ungrudgingly for &ldquo;Tom Burke,&rdquo; that vivid and
chivalrous romance, but he made enemies of authors.&nbsp; He
edited a magazine!&nbsp; Is not that enough?&nbsp; He wearied of
wading through waggon-loads of that pure unmitigated rubbish
which people are permitted to &ldquo;shoot&rdquo; at editorial
doors.&nbsp; How much dust there is in it to how few
pearls!&nbsp; He did not return MSS. punctually and
politely.&nbsp; The office cat could edit the volunteered
contributions of many a magazine, but Lever was even more casual
and careless than an experienced office cat.&nbsp; He grew
crabbed, and tried to quarrel with Mr. Thackeray for that
delightful parody &ldquo;Phil Fogarty,&rdquo; nearly as good as a
genuine story by Lever.</p>
<p>Beset by critics, burlesqued by his friend, he changed his
style (Mr. Fitzpatrick tells us) and became more sober&mdash;and
not so entertaining.&nbsp; He actually published a criticism of
Beyle, of Stendhal, that psychological prig, the darling of
culture and of M. Paul Bourget.&nbsp; Harry Lorrequer on
Stendhal!&mdash;it beggars belief.&nbsp; He nearly fought a duel
with the gentleman who is said to have suggested Mr. Pecksniff to
Dickens!&nbsp; Yet they call his early novels improbable.&nbsp;
Nothing could be less plausible than a combat between Harry
Lorrequer and a gentleman who, even remotely, resembled the
father of Cherry and Merry.</p>
<p>Lever went abroad again, and in Florence or the Baths of
Lucca, in Trieste or Spezia, he passed the rest of his
life.&nbsp; He saw the Italian revolution of 1848, and it added
to his melancholy.&nbsp; This is plain from one of his novels
with a curious history&mdash;&ldquo;Con Cregan.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
wrote it at the same time as &ldquo;The Daltons,&rdquo; and he
did not sign it.&nbsp; The reviewers praised &ldquo;Con
Cregan&rdquo; at the expense of the signed work, rejoicing that
Lever, as &ldquo;The Daltons&rdquo; proved, was exhausted, and
that a new Irish author, the author of &ldquo;Con Cregan,&rdquo;
was coming to eclipse him.&nbsp; In short, he eclipsed himself,
and he did not like it.&nbsp; His right hand was jealous of what
his left hand did.&nbsp; It seems odd that any human being,
however dull and envious, failed to detect Lever in the rapid and
vivacious adventures of his Irish &ldquo;Gil Blas,&rdquo; hero of
one of the very best among his books, a piece not unworthy of
Dumas.&nbsp; &ldquo;Con&rdquo; was written after midnight,
&ldquo;The Daltons&rdquo; in the morning; and there can be no
doubt which set of hours was more favourable to Lever&rsquo;s
genius.&nbsp; Of course he liked &ldquo;The Daltons&rdquo; best;
of all people, authors appear to be their own worst critics.</p>
<p>It is not possible even to catalogue Lever&rsquo;s later books
here.&nbsp; Again he drove a pair of novels
abreast&mdash;&ldquo;The Dodds&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sir Jasper
Carew&rdquo;&mdash;which contain some of his most powerful
situations.&nbsp; When almost an old man, sad, outworn in body,
straitened in circumstances, he still produced excellent tales in
this later manner&mdash;&ldquo;Lord Kilgobbin,&rdquo; &ldquo;That
Boy of Norcott&rsquo;s,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Day&rsquo;s Ride,&rdquo;
and many more.&nbsp; These are the thoughts of a tired man of the
world, who has done and seen everything that such men see and
do.&nbsp; He says that he grew fat, and bald, and grave; he wrote
for the grave and the bald, not for the happier world which is
young, and curly, and merry.&nbsp; He died at last, it is said,
in his sleep; and it is added that he did what Harry Lorrequer
would not have done&mdash;he left his affairs in perfect
order.</p>
<p>Lever lived in an age so full of great novelists that,
perhaps, he is not prized as he should be.&nbsp; Dickens, Bulwer,
Thackeray, Trollope, George Eliot, were his contemporaries.&nbsp;
But when we turn back and read him once more, we see that Lever,
too, was a worthy member of that famous company&mdash;a romancer
for boys and men.</p>
<h2>THE POEMS OF SIR WALTER SCOTT</h2>
<p>Yesterday, as the sun was very bright, and there was no wind,
I took a fishing-rod on chance and Scott&rsquo;s poems, and rowed
into the middle of St. Mary&rsquo;s Loch.&nbsp; Every hill, every
tuft of heather was reflected in the lake, as in a silver
mirror.&nbsp; There was no sound but the lapping of the water
against the boat, the cry of the blackcock from the hill, and the
pleasant plash of a trout rising here and there.&nbsp; So I read
&ldquo;The Lay of the Last Minstrel&rdquo; over again, here, in
the middle of the scenes where the story is laid and where the
fights were fought.&nbsp; For when the Baron went on
pilgrimage,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And took with him this elvish page<br />
To Mary&rsquo;s Chapel of the Lowes,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it was to the ruined chapel <i>here</i> that he came,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For there, beside our Ladye&rsquo;s
lake,<br />
An offering he had sworn to make,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he would pay his vows.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But his enemy, the Lady of Branksome, gathered a band,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of the best that would ride at her
command,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and they all came from the country round.&nbsp; Branksome,
where the lady lived, is twenty miles off, towards the south,
across the ranges of lonely green hills.&nbsp; Harden, where her
ally, Wat of Harden, abode, is within twelve miles; and
Deloraine, where William dwelt, is nearer still; and John of
Thirlestane had his square tower in the heather, &ldquo;where
victual never grew,&rdquo; on Ettrick Water, within ten
miles.&nbsp; These gentlemen, and their kinsfolk and retainers,
being at feud with the Kers, tried to slay the Baron, in the
Chapel of &ldquo;Lone St. Mary of the Waves.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They were three hundred spears and
three.<br />
Through Douglas burn, up Yarrow stream,<br />
Their horses prance, their lances gleam.<br />
They came to St. Mary&rsquo;s Lake ere day;<br />
But the chapel was void, and the Baron away.<br />
They burned the chapel for very rage,<br />
And cursed Lord Cranstoun&rsquo;s goblin-page.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Scotts were a rough clan enough to burn a holy chapel
because they failed to kill their enemy within the sacred
walls.&nbsp; But, as I read again, for the twentieth time, Sir
Walter&rsquo;s poem, floating on the lonely breast of the lake,
in the heart of the hills where Yarrow flows, among the little
green mounds that cover the ruins of chapel and castle and
lady&rsquo;s bower, I asked myself whether Sir Walter was indeed
a great and delightful poet, or whether he pleases me so much
because I was born in his own country, and have one drop of the
blood of his Border robbers in my own veins?</p>
<p>It is not always pleasant to go back to places, or to meet
people, whom we have loved well, long ago.&nbsp; If they have
changed little, we have changed much.&nbsp; The little boy, whose
first book of poetry was &ldquo;The Lady of the Lake,&rdquo; and
who naturally believed that there was no poet like Sir Walter, is
sadly changed into the man who has read most of the world&rsquo;s
poets, and who hears, on many sides, that Scott is outworn and
doomed to deserved oblivion.&nbsp; Are they right or wrong, the
critics who tell us, occasionally, that Scott&rsquo;s good novels
make up for his bad verse, or that verse and prose, all must
go?&nbsp; <i>Pro captu lectoris</i>, by the reader&rsquo;s taste,
they stand or fall; yet even pessimism can scarcely believe that
the Waverley Novels are mortal.&nbsp; They were once the joy of
every class of minds; they cannot cease to be the joy of those
who cling to the permanently good, and can understand and forgive
lapses, carelessnesses, and the leisurely literary fashion of a
former age.&nbsp; But, as to the poems, many give them up who
cling to the novels.&nbsp; It does not follow that the poems are
bad.&nbsp; In the first place, they are of two kinds&mdash;lyric
and narrative.&nbsp; Now, the fashion of narrative in poetry has
passed away for the present.&nbsp; The true Greek epics are read
by a few in Greek; by perhaps fewer still in translations.&nbsp;
But so determined are we not to read tales in verse, that prose
renderings, even of the epics, nay, even of the Attic dramas,
have come more or less into vogue.&nbsp; This accounts for the
comparative neglect of Sir Walter&rsquo;s lays.&nbsp; They are
spoken of as Waverley Novels spoiled.&nbsp; This must always be
the opinion of readers who will not submit to stories in verse;
it by no means follows that the verse is bad.&nbsp; If we make an
exception, which we must, in favour of Chaucer, where is there
better verse in story telling in the whole of English
literature?&nbsp; The readers who despise &ldquo;Marmion,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;The Lady of the Lake,&rdquo; do so because they dislike
stories told in poetry.&nbsp; From poetry they expect other
things, especially a lingering charm and magic of style, a
reflective turn, &ldquo;criticism of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
things, except so far as life can be criticised in action, are
alien to the Muse of narrative.&nbsp; Stories and pictures are
all she offers: Scott&rsquo;s pictures, certainly, are fresh
enough, his tales are excellent enough, his manner is
sufficiently direct.&nbsp; To take examples: every one who wants
to read Scott&rsquo;s poetry should begin with the
&ldquo;Lay.&rdquo;&nbsp; From opening to close it never
falters:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nine and twenty knights of fame<br />
Hung their shields in Branksome Hall;<br />
Nine and twenty squires of name<br />
Brought their steeds to bower from stall,<br />
Nine and twenty yeomen tall<br />
Waited, duteous, on them all . . .<br />
Ten of them were sheathed in steel,<br />
With belted sword, and spur on heel;<br />
They quitted not their harness bright<br />
Neither by day nor yet by night:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They lay down to rest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With corslet laced,<br />
Pillowed on buckler cold and hard;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They carved at the meal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With gloves of steel,<br />
And they drank the red wine through the helmet barred.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, is not that a brave beginning?&nbsp; Does not the verse
clank and chime like sword sheath on spur, like the bits of
champing horses?&nbsp; Then, when William of Deloraine is sent on
his lonely midnight ride across the haunted moors and wolds, does
the verse not gallop like the heavy armoured horse?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Unchallenged, thence passed Deloraine,<br
/>
To ancient Riddell&rsquo;s fair domain,<br />
Where Aill, from mountains freed,<br />
Down from the lakes did raving come;<br />
Each wave was crested with tawny foam,<br />
Like the mane of a chestnut steed,<br />
In vain! no torrent, deep or broad,<br />
Might bar the bold moss-trooper&rsquo;s road;<br />
At the first plunge the horse sunk low,<br />
And the water broke o&rsquo;er the saddle-bow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These last two lines have the very movement and note, the deep
heavy plunge, the still swirl of the water.&nbsp; Well I know the
lochs whence Aill comes red in flood; many a trout have I taken
in Aill, long ago.&nbsp; This, of course, causes a favourable
prejudice, a personal bias towards admiration.&nbsp; But I think
the poetry itself is good, and stirs the spirit, even of those
who know not Ailmoor, the mother of Aill, that lies dark among
the melancholy hills.</p>
<p>The spirit is stirred throughout by the chivalry and the
courage of Scott&rsquo;s men and of his women.&nbsp; Thus the
Lady of Branksome addresses the English invaders who have taken
her boy prisoner:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For the young heir of Branksome&rsquo;s
line,<br />
God be his aid, and God be mine;<br />
Through me no friend shall meet his doom;<br />
Here, while I live, no foe finds room.<br />
Then if thy Lords their purpose urge,<br />
Take our defiance loud and high;<br />
Our slogan is their lyke-wake dirge,<br />
Our moat, the grave where they shall lie.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ay, and though the minstrel says he is no love poet, and
though, indeed, he shines more in war than in lady&rsquo;s bower,
is not this a noble stanza on true love, and worthy of what old
Malory writes in his &ldquo;Mort d&rsquo;Arthur&rdquo;?&nbsp;
Because here Scott speaks for himself, and of his own unhappy and
immortal affection:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;True love&rsquo;s the gift which God has
given<br />
To man alone beneath the Heaven.<br />
It is not Fantasy&rsquo;s hot fire,<br />
Whose wishes, soon as granted, fly;<br />
<i>It liveth not in fierce desire</i>,<br />
<i>With dead desire it dock not die</i>:<br />
It is the secret sympathy,<br />
The silver link, the silken tie,<br />
Which heart to heart and mind to mind,<br />
In body and in soul can bind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Truth and faith, courage and chivalry, a free life in the
hills and by the streams, a shrewd brain, an open heart, a kind
word for friend or foeman, these are what you learn from the
&ldquo;Lay,&rdquo; if you want to learn lessons from
poetry.&nbsp; It is a rude legend, perhaps, as the critics said
at once, when critics were disdainful of wizard priests and
ladies magical.&nbsp; But it is a deathless legend, I hope; it
appeals to every young heart that is not early spoiled by low
cunning, and cynicism, and love of gain.&nbsp; The
minstrel&rsquo;s own prophecy is true, and still, and always,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Yarrow, as he rolls along,<br />
Bears burden to the minstrel&rsquo;s song.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the &ldquo;Lay&rdquo; came &ldquo;Marmion, a Tale of
Flodden Field.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is far more ambitious and
complicated than the &ldquo;Lay,&rdquo; and is not much worse
written.&nbsp; Sir Walter was ever a rapid and careless poet, and
as he took more pains with his plot, he took less with his
verse.&nbsp; His friends reproved him, but he answered to one of
them&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Since oft thy judgment could refine<br />
My flattened thought and cumbrous line,<br />
Still kind, as is thy wont, attend,<br />
And in the minstrel spare the friend:<br />
<i>Though wild as cloud</i>, <i>as stream</i>, <i>as gale</i>,<br
/>
<i>Flow forth</i>, <i>flow unrestrained</i>, <i>my
tale</i>!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any one who knows Scott&rsquo;s country knows how cloud and
stream and gale all sweep at once down the valley of Ettrick or
of Tweed.&nbsp; West wind, wild cloud, red river, they pour forth
as by one impulse&mdash;forth from the far-off hills.&nbsp; He
let his verse sweep out in the same stormy sort, and many a
&ldquo;cumbrous line,&rdquo; many a &ldquo;flattened
thought,&rdquo; you may note, if you will, in
&ldquo;Marmion.&rdquo;&nbsp; For example&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And think what he must next have felt,<br
/>
At buckling of the falchion belt.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;Lay&rdquo; is a tale that only verse could tell;
much of &ldquo;Marmion&rdquo; might have been told in prose, and
most of &ldquo;Rokeby.&rdquo;&nbsp; But prose could never give
the picture of Edinburgh, nor tell the tale of Flodden Fight in
&ldquo;Marmion,&rdquo; which I verily believe is the best
battle-piece in all the poetry of all time, better even than the
stand of Aias by the ships in the Iliad, better than the slaying
of the Wooers in the Odyssey.&nbsp; Nor could prose give us the
hunting of the deer and the long gallop over hillside and down
valley, with which the &ldquo;Lady of the Lake&rdquo; begins,
opening thereby the enchanted gates of the Highlands to the
world.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lady of the Lake,&rdquo; except in the
battle-piece, is told in a less rapid metre than that of the
&ldquo;Lay,&rdquo; less varied than that of
&ldquo;Marmion.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Rokeby&rdquo; lives only by
its songs; the &ldquo;Lord of the Isles&rdquo; by Bannockburn,
the &ldquo;Field of Waterloo&rdquo; by the repulse of the
Cuirassiers.&nbsp; But all the poems are interspersed with songs
and ballads, as the beautiful ballad of &ldquo;Alice
Brand&rdquo;; and Scott&rsquo;s fame rests on <i>these</i> far
more than on his later versified romances.&nbsp; Coming
immediately after the very tamest poets who ever lived, like
Hayley, Scott wrote songs and ballads as wild and free, as
melancholy or gay, as ever shepherd sang, or gipsy carolled, or
witch-wife moaned, or old forgotten minstrel left to the world,
music with no maker&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; For example, take the
Outlaw&rsquo;s rhyme&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With burnished brand and musketoon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So gallantly you come,<br />
I read you for a bold dragoon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That lists the tuck of drum.<br />
I list no more the tuck of drum,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No more the trumpet hear;<br />
But when the beetle sounds his hum,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My comrades take the spear.<br />
And, oh, though Brignal banks be fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Greta woods be gay,<br />
Yet mickle must the maiden dare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would reign my Queen of May!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How musical, again, is this!&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This morn is merry June, I trow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The rose is budding fain;<br />
But she shall bloom in winter snow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere we two meet again.<br />
He turned his charger as he spake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the river shore,<br />
He gave his bridle-reins a shake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Said, &lsquo;Adieu for evermore,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My love!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Adieu for evermore!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turning from the legends in verse, let it not be forgotten
that Scott was a great lyrical poet.&nbsp; Mr. Palgrave is not
too lenient a judge, and his &ldquo;Golden Treasury&rdquo; is a
touchstone, as well as a treasure, of poetic gold.&nbsp; In this
volume Wordsworth contributes more lyrics than any other poet:
Shelley and Shakespeare come next; then Sir Walter.&nbsp; For my
part I would gladly sacrifice a few of Wordsworth&rsquo;s for a
few more of Scott&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But this may be prejudice.&nbsp;
Mr. Palgrave is not prejudiced, and we see how high is his value
for Sir Walter.</p>
<p>There are scores of songs in his works, touching and sad, or
gay as a hunter&rsquo;s waking, that tell of lovely things lost
by tradition, and found by him on the moors: all these&mdash;not
prized by Sir Walter himself&mdash;are in his gift, and in that
of no other man.&nbsp; For example, his &ldquo;Eve of St.
John&rdquo; is simply a masterpiece, a ballad among
ballads.&nbsp; Nothing but an old song moves us like&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Are these the links o&rsquo; Forth, she
said,<br />
Are these the bends o&rsquo; Dee!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He might have done more of the best, had he very greatly
cared.&nbsp; Alone among poets, he had neither vanity nor
jealousy; he thought little of his own verse and his own fame:
would that he had thought more! would that he had been more
careful of what was so precious!&nbsp; But he turned to prose;
bade poetry farewell.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Yet, once again, farewell, thou Minstrel
Harp,<br />
Yet, once again, forgive my feeble sway.<br />
<i>And little reck I of the censure sharp<br />
May idly cavil at an idle lay</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People still cavil idly, complaining that Scott did not
finish, or did not polish his pieces; that he was not Keats, or
was not Wordsworth.&nbsp; He was himself; he was the Last
Minstrel, the latest, the greatest, the noblest of natural poets
concerned with natural things.&nbsp; He sang of free, fierce, and
warlike life, of streams yet rich in salmon, and moors not yet
occupied by brewers; of lonely places haunted in the long grey
twilights of the North; of crumbling towers where once dwelt the
Lady of Branksome or the Flower of Yarrow.&nbsp; Nature summed up
in him many a past age a world of ancient faiths; and before the
great time of Britain wholly died, to Britain, as to Greece, she
gave her Homer.&nbsp; When he was old, and tired, and near his
death&mdash;so worn with trouble and labour that he actually
signed his own name wrong&mdash;he wrote his latest verse, for a
lady.&nbsp; It ends&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My country, be thou glorious
still!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and so he died, within the sound of the whisper of Tweed,
foreseeing the years when his country would no more be glorious,
thinking of his country only, forgetting quite the private sorrow
of his own later days.</p>
<p>People will tell you that Scott was not a great poet; that his
bolt is shot, his fame perishing.&nbsp; Little he cared for his
fame!&nbsp; But for my part I think and hope that Scott can never
die, till men grow up into manhood without ever having been
boys&mdash;till they forget that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One glorious hour of crowded life<br />
Is worth an age without a name!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the charges against Sir Walter&rsquo;s poetry are, on
the whole, little more than the old critical fallacy of blaming a
thing for not being something else.&nbsp; &ldquo;It takes all
sorts to make a world,&rdquo; in poetry as in life.&nbsp; Sir
Walter&rsquo;s sort is a very good sort, and in English
literature its place was empty, and waiting for him.&nbsp; Think
of what he did.&nbsp; English poetry had long been very tame and
commonplace, written in couplets like Pope&rsquo;s, very
artificial and smart, or sensible and slow.&nbsp; He came with
poems of which the music seemed to gallop, like thundering hoofs
and ringing bridles of a rushing border troop.&nbsp; Here were
goblin, ghost, and fairy, fight and foray, fair ladies and true
lovers, gallant knights and hard blows, blazing beacons on every
hill crest and on the bartisan of every tower.&nbsp; Here was a
world made alive again that had been dead for three hundred
years&mdash;a world of men and women.</p>
<p>They say that the arch&aelig;ology is not good.&nbsp;
Arch&aelig;ology is a science; in its application to poetry,
Scott was its discoverer.&nbsp; Others can name the plates of a
coat of armour more learnedly than he, but he made men wear
them.&nbsp; They call his Gothic art false, his armour
pasteboard; but he put living men under his castled roofs, living
men into his breastplates and taslets.&nbsp; Science advances,
old knowledge becomes ignorance; it is poetry that does not die,
and that will not die, while&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The triple pride<br />
Of Eildon looks over Strathclyde.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>JOHN BUNYAN</h2>
<p>Dr. Johnson once took Bishop Percy&rsquo;s little daughter on
his knee, and asked her what she thought of the
&ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress.&rdquo;&nbsp; The child answered
that she had not read it.&nbsp; &ldquo;No?&rdquo; replied the
Doctor; &ldquo;then I would not give one farthing for you,&rdquo;
and he set her down and took no further notice of her.</p>
<p>This story, if true, proves that the Doctor was rather
intolerant.&nbsp; We must not excommunicate people because they
have not our taste in books.&nbsp; The majority of people do not
care for books at all.</p>
<p>There is a descendant of John Bunyan&rsquo;s alive now, or
there was lately, who never read the &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress.&rdquo;&nbsp; Books are not in his line.&nbsp; Nay,
Bunyan himself, who wrote sixty works, was no great reader.&nbsp;
An Oxford scholar who visited him in his study found no books at
all, except some of Bunyan&rsquo;s own and Foxe&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Book of Martyrs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, little as the world in general cares for reading, it has
read Bunyan more than most.&nbsp; One hundred thousand copies of
the &ldquo;Pilgrim&rdquo; are believed to have been sold in his
own day, and the story has been done into the most savage
languages, as well as into those of the civilised world.</p>
<p>Dr. Johnson, who did not like Dissenters, praises the
&ldquo;invention, imagination, and conduct of the story,&rdquo;
and knew no other book he wished longer except &ldquo;Robinson
Crusoe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Don Quixote.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, Dr.
Johnson would not have given a farthing for <i>me</i>, as I am
quite contented with the present length of these
masterpieces.&nbsp; What books do <i>you</i> wish longer?&nbsp; I
wish Homer had written a continuation of the Odyssey, and told us
what Odysseus did among the far-off men who never tasted salt nor
heard of the sea.&nbsp; A land epic after the sea epic, how good
it would have been&mdash;from Homer!&nbsp; But it would have
taxed the imagination of Dante to continue the adventures of
Christian and his wife after they had once crossed the river and
reached the city.</p>
<p>John Bunyan has been more fortunate than most authors in one
of his biographies.</p>
<p>His life has been written by the Rev. Dr. Brown, who is now
minister of his old congregation at Bedford; and an excellent
life it is.&nbsp; Dr. Brown is neither Roundhead nor Cavalier;
for though he is, of course, on Bunyan&rsquo;s side, he does not
throw stones at the beautiful Church of England.</p>
<p>Probably most of us are on Bunyan&rsquo;s side now.&nbsp; It
might be a good thing that we should all dwell together in
religious unity, but history shows that people cannot be bribed
into brotherhood.&nbsp; They tried to bully Bunyan; they arrested
and imprisoned him&mdash;unfairly even in law, according to Dr.
Brown, not unfairly, Mr. Froude thinks&mdash;and he would not be
bullied.</p>
<p>What was much more extraordinary, he would not be
embittered.&nbsp; In spite of all, he still called Charles II.
&ldquo;a gracious Prince.&rdquo;&nbsp; When a subject is in
conscience at variance with the law, Bunyan said, he has but one
course&mdash;to accept peaceably the punishment which the law
awards.&nbsp; He was never soured, never angered by twelve years
of durance, not exactly in a loathsome dungeon, but in very
uncomfortable quarters.&nbsp; When there came a brief interval of
toleration, he did not occupy himself in brawling, but in
preaching, and looking after the manners and morals of the little
&ldquo;church,&rdquo; including one woman who brought
disagreeable charges against &ldquo;Brother
Honeylove.&rdquo;&nbsp; The church decided that there was nothing
in the charges, but somehow the name of Brother Honeylove does
not inspire confidence.</p>
<p>Almost everybody knows the main facts of Bunyan&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; They may not know that he was of Norman descent (as
Dr. Brown seems to succeed in proving), nor that the Bunyans came
over with the Conqueror, nor that he was a gipsy, as others
hold.&nbsp; On Dr. Brown&rsquo;s showing, Bunyan&rsquo;s
ancestors lost their lands in process of time and change, and
Bunyan&rsquo;s father was a tinker.&nbsp; He preferred to call
himself a brazier&mdash;his was the rather unexpected trade to
which Mr. Dick proposed apprenticing David Copperfield.</p>
<p>Bunyan himself, &ldquo;the wondrous babe,&rdquo; as Dr. Brown
enthusiastically styles him, was christened on November 30th,
1628.&nbsp; He was born in a cottage, long fallen, and hard by
was a marshy place, &ldquo;a veritable slough of
despond.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bunyan may have had it in mind when he
wrote of the slough where Christian had so much trouble.&nbsp; He
was not a travelled man: all his knowledge of people and places
he found at his doors.&nbsp; He had some schooling,
&ldquo;according to the rate of other poor men&rsquo;s
children,&rdquo; and assuredly it was enough.</p>
<p>The great civil war broke out, and Bunyan was a soldier; he
tells us not on which side.&nbsp; Dr. Brown and Mr. Lewis Morris
think he was on that of the Parliament, but his old father, the
tinker, stood for the King.&nbsp; Mr. Froude is rather more
inclined to hold that he was among the &ldquo;gay gallants who
struck for the crown.&rdquo;&nbsp; He does not seem to have been
much under fire, but he got that knowledge of the appearance of
war which he used in his siege of the City of Mansoul.&nbsp; One
can hardly think that Bunyan liked war&mdash;certainly not from
cowardice, but from goodness of heart.</p>
<p>In 1646 the army was disbanded, and Bunyan went back to Elstow
village and his tinkering, his bell-ringing, his dancing with the
girls, his playing at &ldquo;cat&rdquo; on a Sunday after
service.</p>
<p>He married very young and poor.&nbsp; He married a pious wife,
and read all her library&mdash;&ldquo;The Plain Man&rsquo;s
Pathway to Heaven,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Practice of
Piety.&rdquo;&nbsp; He became very devout in the spirit of the
Church of England, and he gave up his amusements.&nbsp; Then he
fell into the Slough of Despond, then he went through the Valley
of the Shadow, and battled with Apollyon.</p>
<p>People have wondered <i>why</i> he fancied himself such a
sinner?&nbsp; He confesses to having been a liar and a
blasphemer.&nbsp; If I may guess, I fancy that this was merely
the literary genius of Bunyan seeking for expression.&nbsp; His
lies, I would go bail, were tremendous romances, wild fictions
told for fun, never lies of cowardice or for gain.&nbsp; As to
his blasphemies, he had an extraordinary power of language, and
that was how he gave it play.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fancy swearing&rdquo;
was his only literary safety-valve, in those early days, when he
played cat on Elstow Green.</p>
<p>Then he heard a voice dart from heaven into his soul, which
said, &ldquo;Wilt thou leave thy sins and go to heaven, or have
thy sins and go to hell?&rdquo;&nbsp; So he fell on repentance,
and passed those awful years of mental torture, when all nature
seemed to tempt him to the Unknown Sin.</p>
<p>What did all this mean?&nbsp; It meant that Bunyan was within
an ace of madness.</p>
<p>It happens to a certain proportion of men, religiously brought
up, to suffer like Bunyan.&nbsp; They hear voices, they are
afraid of that awful unknown iniquity, and of eternal death, as
Bunyan and Cowper were afraid.</p>
<p>Was it not De Quincey who was at school with a bully who
believed he had been guilty of the unpardonable offence?&nbsp;
Bullying is an offence much less pardonable than most men are
guilty of.&nbsp; Their best plan (in Bunyan&rsquo;s misery) is to
tell Apollyon that the Devil is an ass, to do their work and
speak the truth.</p>
<p>Bunyan got quit of his terror at last, briefly by believing in
the goodness of God.&nbsp; He did not say, like Mr. Carlyle,
&ldquo;Well, if all my fears are true, what then?&rdquo;&nbsp;
His was a Christian, not a stoical deliverance.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;church&rdquo; in which Bunyan found shelter had for
minister a converted major in a Royalist regiment.&nbsp; It was a
quaint little community, the members living like the early
disciples, correcting each other&rsquo;s faults, and keeping a
severe eye on each other&rsquo;s lives.&nbsp; Bunyan became a
minister in it; but, Puritan as he was, he lets his Pilgrims
dance on joyful occasions, and even Mr. Ready-to-Halt waltzes
with a young lady of the Pilgrim company.</p>
<p>As a minister and teacher Bunyan began to write books of
controversy with Quakers and clergymen.&nbsp; The points debated
are no longer important to us; the main thing was that he got a
pen into his hand, and found a proper outlet for his genius, a
better way than fancy swearing.</p>
<p>If he had not been cast into Bedford jail for preaching in a
cottage, he might never have dreamed his immortal dream, nor
become all that he was.&nbsp; The leisures of gaol were
long.&nbsp; In that &ldquo;den&rdquo; the Muse came to him, the
fair kind Muse of the Home Beautiful.&nbsp; He saw all that
company of his, so like and so unlike Chaucer&rsquo;s: Faithful,
and Hopeful, and Christian, the fellowship of fiends, the
truculent Cavaliers of Vanity Fair, and Giant Despair, with his
grievous crabtree cudgel; and other people he saw who are with us
always,&mdash;the handsome Madam Bubble, and the young woman
whose name was Dull, and Mr. Worldly Wiseman, and Mr. Facing
Bothways, and Byends, all the persons of the comedy of human
life.</p>
<p>He hears the angelic songs of the City beyond the river; he
hears them, but repeat them to us he cannot, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m
no poet,&rdquo; as he says himself.&nbsp; He beheld the country
of Beulah, and the Delectable Mountains, that earthly Paradise of
nature where we might be happy yet, and wander no farther, if the
world would let us&mdash;fair mountains in whose streams Izaak
Walton was then even casting angle.</p>
<p>It is pleasant to fancy how Walton and Bunyan might have met
and talked, under a plane tree by the Ouse, while the May showers
were falling.&nbsp; Surely Bunyan would not have likened the good
old man to Formalist; and certainly Walton would have enjoyed
travelling with Christian, though the book was by none of his
dear bishops, but by a Non-conformist.&nbsp; They were made to
like but not to convert each other; in matters ecclesiastical
they saw the opposite sides of the shield.&nbsp; Each wrote a
masterpiece.&nbsp; It is too late to praise &ldquo;The Complete
Angler&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress.&rdquo;&nbsp; You may put ingenuity on the rack, but she
can say nothing new that is true about the best romance that ever
was wedded to allegory, nor about the best idyl of old English
life.</p>
<p>The people are living now&mdash;all the people: the noisy
bullying judges, as of the French Revolutionary Courts, or the
Hanging Courts after Monmouth&rsquo;s war; the demure, grave
Puritan girls; and Matthew, who had the gripes; and lazy,
feckless Ignorance, who came to so ill an end, poor fellow; and
sturdy Old Honest, and timid Mr. Fearing; not single persons, but
dozens, arise on the memory.</p>
<p>They come, as fresh, as vivid, as if they were out of Scott or
Moli&egrave;re; the Tinker is as great a master of character and
fiction as the greatest, almost; his style is pure, and plain,
and sound, full of old idioms, and even of something like old
slang.&nbsp; But even his slang is classical.</p>
<p>Bunyan is everybody&rsquo;s author.&nbsp; The very Catholics
have their own edition of the Pilgrim: they have cut out Giant
Pope, but have been too good-natured to insert Giant Protestant
in his place.&nbsp; Unheralded, unannounced, though not
uncriticised (they accused the Tinker of being a plagiarist, of
course), Bunyan outshone the Court wits, the learned, the poets
of the Restoration, and even the great theologians.</p>
<p>His other books, except &ldquo;Grace Abounding&rdquo; (an
autobiography), &ldquo;The Holy War,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr.
Badman,&rdquo; are only known to students, nor much read by
them.&nbsp; The fashion of his theology, as of all theology,
passed away; it is by virtue of his imagination, of his romance,
that he lives.</p>
<p>The allegory, of course, is full of flaws.&nbsp; It would not
have been manly of Christian to run off and save his own soul,
leaving his wife and family.&nbsp; But Bunyan shrank from showing
us how difficult, if not impossible, it is for a married man to
be a saint.&nbsp; Christiana was really with him all through that
pilgrimage; and how he must have been hampered by that woman of
the world!&nbsp; But had the allegory clung more closely to the
skirts of truth, it would have changed from a romance to a
satire, from &ldquo;The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rdquo; to
&ldquo;Vanity Fair.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was too much love in
Bunyan for a satirist of that kind; he had just enough for a
humourist.</p>
<p>Born in another class, he might have been, he would have been,
a writer more refined in his strength, more uniformly excellent,
but never so universal nor so popular in the best sense of the
term.</p>
<p>In the change of times and belief it is not impossible that
Bunyan will live among the class whom he least thought of
addressing&mdash;scholars, lovers of worldly literature&mdash;for
devotion and poverty are parting company, while art endures till
civilisation perishes.</p>
<p>Are we better or worse for no longer believing as Bunyan
believed, no longer seeing that Abyss of Pascal&rsquo;s open
beside our armchairs?&nbsp; The question is only a form of that
wide riddle, Does any theological or philosophical opinion make
us better or worse?&nbsp; The vast majority of men and women are
little affected by schemes and theories of this life and the
next.&nbsp; They who even ask for a reply to the riddle are the
few: most of us take the easy-going morality of our world for a
guide, as we take Bradshaw for a railway journey.&nbsp; It is the
few who must find out an answer: on that answer their lives
depend, and the lives of others are insensibly raised towards
their level.&nbsp; Bunyan would not have been a worse man if he
had shared the faith of Izaak Walton.&nbsp; Izaak had his reply
to all questions in the Church Catechism and the Articles.&nbsp;
Bunyan found his in the theology of his sect, appealing more
strongly than orthodoxy to a nature more bellicose than
Izaak&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Men like him, with his indomitable courage,
will never lack a solution of the puzzle of the earth.&nbsp; At
worst they will live by law, whether they dare to speak of it as
God&rsquo;s law, or dare not.&nbsp; They will always be our
leaders, our Captain Greathearts, in the pilgrimage to the city
where, led or unled, we must all at last arrive.&nbsp; They will
not fail us, while loyalty and valour are human qualities.&nbsp;
The day may conceivably come when we have no Christian to march

<h2>TO A YOUNG JOURNALIST</h2>
<p>Dear Smith,&mdash;</p>
<p>You inform me that you desire to be a journalist, and you are
kind enough to ask my advice.&nbsp; Well, be a journalist, by all
means, in any honest and honourable branch of the
profession.&nbsp; But do not be an eavesdropper and a spy.&nbsp;
You may fly into a passion when you receive this very plainly
worded advice.&nbsp; I hope you will; but, for several reasons,
which I now go on to state, I fear that you won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I
fear that, either by natural gift or by acquired habit, you
already possess the imperturbable temper which will be so useful
to you if you do join the army of spies and eavesdroppers.&nbsp;
If I am right, you have made up your mind to refuse to take
offence, as long as by not taking offence you can wriggle
yourself forward in the band of journalistic reptiles.&nbsp; You
will be revenged on me, in that case, some day; you will lie in
wait for me with a dirty bludgeon, and steal on me out of a
sewer.&nbsp; If you do, permit me to assure you that I
don&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; But if you are already in a rage, if you
are about tearing up this epistle, and are starting to assault me
personally, or at least to answer me furiously, then there is
every hope for you and for your future.&nbsp; I therefore venture
to state my reasons for supposing that you are inclined to begin
a course which your father, if he were alive, would deplore, as
all honourable men in their hearts must deplore it.&nbsp; When
you were at the University (let me congratulate you on your
degree) you edited, or helped to edit, <i>The Bull-dog</i>.&nbsp;
It was not a very brilliant nor a very witty, but it was an
extremely &ldquo;racy&rdquo; periodical.&nbsp; It spoke of all
men and dons by their nicknames.&nbsp; It was full of second-hand
slang.&nbsp; It contained many personal anecdotes, to the
detriment of many people.&nbsp; It printed garbled and spiteful
versions of private conversations on private affairs.&nbsp; It
did not even spare to make comments on ladies, and on the details
of domestic life in the town and in the University.&nbsp; The
copies which you sent me I glanced at with extreme disgust.</p>
<p>In my time, more than a score of years ago, a similar
periodical, but a much more clever periodical, was put forth by
members of the University.&nbsp; It contained a novel which, even
now, would be worth several ill-gotten guineas to the makers of
the <i>chronique scandaleuse</i>.&nbsp; But nobody bought it, and
it died an early death.&nbsp; Times have altered, I am a fogey;
but the ideas of honour and decency which fogies hold now were
held by young men in the sixties of our century.&nbsp; I know
very well that these ideas are obsolete.&nbsp; I am not preaching
to the world, nor hoping to convert society, but to <i>you</i>,
and purely in your own private, spiritual interest.&nbsp; If you
enter on this path of tattle, mendacity, and malice, and if, with
your cleverness and light hand, you are successful, society will
not turn its back on you.&nbsp; You will be feared in many
quarters, and welcomed in others.&nbsp; Of your paragraphs people
will say that &ldquo;it is a shame, of course, but it is very
amusing.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are so many shames in the world,
shames not at all amusing, that you may see no harm in adding to
the number.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; you may
argue, &ldquo;some one else will.&rdquo;&nbsp; Undoubtedly; but
<i>why should you do it</i>?</p>
<p>You are not a starving scribbler; if you determine to write,
you can write well, though not so easily, on many topics.&nbsp;
You have not that last sad excuse of hunger, which drives poor
women to the streets, and makes unhappy men act as public blabs
and spies.&nbsp; If <i>you</i> take to this <i>m&eacute;tier</i>,
it must be because you like it, which means that you enjoy being
a listener to and reporter of talk that was never meant for any
ears except those in which it was uttered.&nbsp; It means that
the hospitable board is not sacred for <i>you</i>; it means that,
with you, friendship, honour, all that makes human life better
than a low smoking-room, are only valuable for what their
betrayal will bring.&nbsp; It means that not even the welfare of
your country will prevent you from running to the Press with any
secret which you may have been entrusted with, or which you may
have surprised.&nbsp; It means, this peculiar kind of profession,
that all things open and excellent, and conspicuous to all men,
are with you of no account.&nbsp; Art, literature, politics, are
to cease to interest you.&nbsp; You are to scheme to surprise
gossip about the private lives, dress, and talk of artists, men
of letters, politicians.&nbsp; Your professional work will sink
below the level of servants&rsquo; gossip in a public-house
parlour.&nbsp; If you happen to meet a man of known name, you
will watch him, will listen to him, will try to sneak into his
confidence, and you will blab, for money, about him, and your
blab will inevitably be mendacious.&nbsp; In short, like the most
pitiable outcasts of womankind, and, without their excuse, you
will live by selling your honour.&nbsp; You will not suffer much,
nor suffer long.&nbsp; Your conscience will very speedily be
seared with a red-hot iron.&nbsp; You will be on the road which
leads from mere dishonour to crime; and you may find yourself
actually practising <i>chantage</i>, and extorting money as the
price of your silence.&nbsp; This is the lowest deep: the vast
majority, even of social <i>mouchards</i>, do not sink so low as
this.</p>
<p>The profession of the critic, even in honourable and open
criticism, is beset with dangers.&nbsp; It is often hard to avoid
saying an unkind thing, a cruel thing, which is smart, and which
may even be deserved.&nbsp; Who can say that he has escaped this
temptation, and what man of heart can think of his own fall
without a sense of shame?&nbsp; There are, I admit, authors so
antipathetic to me, that I cannot trust myself to review
them.&nbsp; Would that I had never reviewed them!&nbsp; They
cannot be so bad as they seem to me: they must have qualities
which escape my observation.&nbsp; Then there is the temptation
to hit back.&nbsp; Some one writes, unjustly or unkindly as you
think, of you or of your friends.&nbsp; You wait till your enemy
has written a book, and then you have your innings.&nbsp; It is
not in nature that your review should be fair: you must
inevitably be more on the look-out for faults than merits.&nbsp;
The <i>&eacute;reintage</i>, the &ldquo;smashing&rdquo; of a
literary foe is very delightful at the moment, but it does not
look well in the light of reflection.&nbsp; But these deeds are
mere peccadilloes compared with the confirmed habit of regarding
all men and women as fair game for personal tattle and the sating
of private spite.&nbsp; Nobody, perhaps, begins with this
intention.&nbsp; Most men and women can find ready
sophistries.&nbsp; If a report about any one reaches their ears,
they say that they are doing him a service by publishing it and
enabling him to contradict it.&nbsp; As if any mortal ever
listened to a contradiction!&nbsp; And there are
charges&mdash;that of plagiarism, for example&mdash;which can
never be disproved, even if contradictions were listened to by
the public.&nbsp; The accusation goes everywhere, is copied into
every printed rag; the contradiction dies with the daily death of
a single newspaper.&nbsp; You may reply that a man of sense will
be indifferent to false accusations.&nbsp; He may, or may not
be,&mdash;that is not the question for you; the question for you
is whether you will circulate news that is false, probably, and
spiteful, certainly.</p>
<p>In short, the whole affair regards yourself more than it
regards the world.&nbsp; Plenty of poison is sold: is it well for
you to be one of the merchants?&nbsp; Is it the business of an
educated gentleman to live by the trade of an eavesdropper and a
blab?&nbsp; In the Memoirs of M. Blowitz he tells you how he
began his illustrious career by procuring the publication of
remarks which M. Thiers had made to him.&nbsp; He then
&ldquo;went to see M. Thiers, not without some
apprehension.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is that the kind of emotion which you
wish to be habitual in your experience?&nbsp; Do you think it
agreeable to become shame-faced when you meet people who have
conversed with you frankly?&nbsp; Do you enjoy being a sneak, and
feeling like a sneak?&nbsp; Do you find blushing pleasant?&nbsp;
Of course you will soon lose the power of blushing; but is that
an agreeable prospect?&nbsp; Depend on it, there are discomforts
in the progress to the brazen, in the journey to the
shameless.&nbsp; You may, if your tattle is political, become
serviceable to men engaged in great affairs.&nbsp; They may even
ask you to their houses, if that is your ambition.&nbsp; You may
urge that they condone your deeds, and are even art and part in
them.&nbsp; But you must also be aware that they call you, and
think you, a reptile.&nbsp; You are not one of those who will do
the devil&rsquo;s work without the devil&rsquo;s wages; but do
you seriously think that the wages are worth the degradation?</p>
<p>Many men think so, and are not in other respects bad
men.&nbsp; They may even be kindly and genial.&nbsp; Gentlemen
they cannot be, nor men of delicacy, nor men of honour.&nbsp;
They have sold themselves and their self-respect, some with ease
(they are the least blamable), some with a struggle.&nbsp; They
have seen better things, and perhaps vainly long to return to
them.&nbsp; These are &ldquo;St. Satan&rsquo;s Penitents,&rdquo;
and their remorse is vain:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Virtutem videant</i>, <i>intabescantque
relicta</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t wish to be of this dismal company, there is
only one course open to you.&nbsp; Never write for publication
one line of personal tattle.&nbsp; Let all men&rsquo;s persons
and private lives be as sacred to you as your
father&rsquo;s,&mdash;though there are tattlers who would sell
paragraphs about their own mothers if there were a market for the
ware.&nbsp; There is no half-way house on this road.&nbsp; Once
begin to print private conversation, and you are lost&mdash;lost,
that is, to delicacy and gradually, to many other things
excellent and of good report.&nbsp; The whole question for you
is, Do you mind incurring this damnation?&nbsp; If there is
nothing in it which appals and revolts you, if your conscience is
satisfied with a few ready sophisms, or if you don&rsquo;t care a
pin for your conscience, fall to!</p>
<p><i>Vous irez loin</i>!&nbsp; You will prattle in print about
men&rsquo;s private lives their hidden motives, their waistcoats,
their wives, their boots, their businesses, their incomes.&nbsp;
Most of your prattle will inevitably be lies.&nbsp; But go on!
nobody will kick you, I deeply regret to say.&nbsp; You will earn
money.&nbsp; You will be welcomed in society.&nbsp; You will live
and die content, and without remorse.&nbsp; I do not suppose that
any particular <i>inferno</i> will await you in the future
life.&nbsp; Whoever watches this world &ldquo;with larger other
eyes than ours&rdquo; will doubtless make allowance for you, as
for us all.&nbsp; I am not pretending to be a whit better than
you; probably I am worse in many ways, but not in your way.&nbsp;
Putting it merely as a matter of taste, I don&rsquo;t like the
way.&nbsp; It makes me sick&mdash;that is all.&nbsp; It is a sin
which I can comfortably damn, as I am not inclined to it.&nbsp;
You may put it in that light; and I have no way of converting
you, nor, if I have not dissuaded you, of dissuading you, from
continuing, on a larger scale, your practices in <i>The
Bull-dog</i>.</p>
<h2>MR. KIPLING&rsquo;S STORIES</h2>
<p>The wind bloweth where it listeth.&nbsp; But the wind of
literary inspiration has rarely shaken the bungalows of India,
as, in the tales of the old Jesuit missionaries, the magical air
shook the frail &ldquo;medicine tents,&rdquo; where Huron
conjurors practised their mysteries.&nbsp; With a world of
romance and of character at their doors, Englishmen in India have
seen as if they saw it not.&nbsp; They have been busy in
governing, in making war, making peace, building bridges, laying
down roads, and writing official reports.&nbsp; Our literature
from that continent of our conquest has been sparse indeed,
except in the way of biographies, of histories, and of rather
local and unintelligible <i>faceti&aelig;</i>.&nbsp; Except the
novels by the author of &ldquo;Tara,&rdquo; and Sir Henry
Cunningham&rsquo;s brilliant sketches, such as
&ldquo;Dustypore,&rdquo; and Sir Alfred Lyall&rsquo;s poems, we
might almost say that India has contributed nothing to our finer
literature.&nbsp; That old haunt of history, the wealth of
character brought out in that confusion of races, of religions,
and the old and new, has been wealth untouched, a treasure-house
sealed: those pagoda trees have never been shaken.&nbsp; At last
there comes an Englishman with eyes, with a pen extraordinarily
deft, an observation marvellously rapid and keen; and, by good
luck, this Englishman has no official duties: he is neither a
soldier, nor a judge; he is merely a man of letters.&nbsp; He has
leisure to look around him, he has the power of making us see
what he sees; and, when we have lost India, when some new power
is ruling where we ruled, when our empire has followed that of
the Moguls, future generations will learn from Mr.
Kipling&rsquo;s works what India was under English sway.</p>
<p>It is one of the surprises of literature that these tiny
masterpieces in prose and verse were poured, &ldquo;as rich men
give that care not for their gifts,&rdquo; into the columns of
Anglo-Indian journals.&nbsp; There they were thought clever and
ephemeral&mdash;part of the chatter of the week.&nbsp; The
subjects, no doubt, seemed so familiar, that the strength of the
handling, the brilliance of the colour, were scarcely
recognised.&nbsp; But Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s volumes no sooner
reached England than the people into whose hands they fell were
certain that here were the beginnings of a new literary
force.&nbsp; The books had the strangeness, the colour, the
variety, the perfume of the East.&nbsp; Thus it is no wonder that
Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s repute grew up as rapidly as the mysterious
mango tree of the conjurors.&nbsp; There were critics, of course,
ready to say that the thing was merely a trick, and had nothing
of the supernatural.&nbsp; That opinion is not likely to hold its
ground.&nbsp; Perhaps the most severe of the critics has been a
young Scotch gentleman, writing French, and writing it
wonderfully well, in a Parisian review.&nbsp; He chose to regard
Mr. Kipling as little but an imitator of Bret Harte, deriving his
popularity mainly from the novel and exotic character of his
subjects.&nbsp; No doubt, if Mr. Kipling has a literary
progenitor, it is Mr. Bret Harte.&nbsp; Among his earlier verses
a few are what an imitator of the American might have written in
India.&nbsp; But it is a wild judgment which traces Mr.
Kipling&rsquo;s success to his use, for example, of Anglo-Indian
phrases and scraps of native dialects.&nbsp; The presence of
these elements is among the causes which have made Englishmen
think Anglo-Indian literature tediously provincial, and India a
bore.&nbsp; Mr. Kipling, on the other hand, makes us regard the
continent which was a bore an enchanted land, full of marvels and
magic which are real.&nbsp; There has, indeed, arisen a taste for
exotic literature: people have become alive to the strangeness
and fascination of the world beyond the bounds of Europe and the
United States.&nbsp; But that is only because men of imagination
and literary skill have been the new conquerors&mdash;the
Corteses and Balboas of India, Africa, Australia, Japan, and the
isles of the southern seas.&nbsp; All such conquerors, whether
they write with the polish of M. Pierre Loti, or with the
carelessness of Mr. Boldrewood, have, at least, seen new worlds
for themselves; have gone out of the streets of the
over-populated lands into the open air; have sailed and ridden,
walked and hunted; have escaped from the fog and smoke of
towns.&nbsp; New strength has come from fresher air into their
brains and blood; hence the novelty and buoyancy of the stories
which they tell.&nbsp; Hence, too, they are rather to be counted
among romanticists than realists, however real is the essential
truth of their books.&nbsp; They have found so much to see and to
record, that they are not tempted to use the microscope, and pore
for ever on the minute in character.&nbsp; A great deal of
realism, especially in France, attracts because it is novel,
because M. Zola and others have also found new worlds to
conquer.&nbsp; But certain provinces in those worlds were not
unknown to, but were voluntarily neglected by, earlier
explorers.&nbsp; They were the &ldquo;Bad Lands&rdquo; of life
and character: surely it is wiser to seek quite new realms than
to build mud huts and dunghills on the &ldquo;Bad
Lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s work, like all good work, is both real and
romantic.&nbsp; It is real because he sees and feels very swiftly
and keenly; it is romantic, again, because he has a sharp eye for
the reality of romance, for the attraction and possibility of
adventure, and because he is young.&nbsp; If a reader wants to
see petty characters displayed in all their meannesses, if this
be realism, surely certain of Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s painted and
frisky matrons are realistic enough.&nbsp; The seamy side of
Anglo-Indian life: the intrigues, amorous or
semi-political&mdash;the slang of people who describe dining as
&ldquo;mangling garbage&rdquo; the &ldquo;games of tennis with
the seventh commandment&rdquo;&mdash;he has not neglected any of
these.&nbsp; Probably the sketches are true enough, and pity
&rsquo;tis true: for example, the sketches in &ldquo;Under the
Deodars&rdquo; and in &ldquo;The Gadsbys.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
worthy pair, with their friends, are to myself as unsympathetic,
almost, as the characters in &ldquo;La Conqu&ecirc;te de
Plassans.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Mr. Kipling is too much a true realist
to make their selfishness and pettiness unbroken,
unceasing.&nbsp; We know that &ldquo;Gaddy&rdquo; is a brave,
modest, and hard-working soldier; and, when his little silly
bride (who prefers being kissed by a man with waxed moustaches)
lies near to death, certainly I am nearer to tears than when I am
obliged to attend the bed of Little Dombey or of Little
Nell.&nbsp; Probably there is a great deal of slangy and
unrefined Anglo-Indian society; and, no doubt, to sketch it in
its true colours is not beyond the province of art.&nbsp; At
worst it is redeemed, in part, by its constancy in the presence
of various perils&mdash;from disease, and from &ldquo;the bullet
flying down the pass.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Kipling may not be, and
very probably is not, a reader of &ldquo;Gyp&rdquo;; but
&ldquo;The Gadsbys,&rdquo; especially, reads like the work of an
Anglo-Indian disciple, trammelled by certain English
conventions.&nbsp; The more Pharisaic realists&mdash;those of the
strictest sect&mdash;would probably welcome Mr. Kipling as a
younger brother, so far as &ldquo;Under the Deodars&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Gadsbys&rdquo; are concerned, if he were not
occasionally witty and even flippant, as well as realistic.&nbsp;
But, very fortunately, he has not confined his observation to the
leisures and pleasures of Simla; he has looked out also on war
and on sport, on the life of all native tribes and castes; and
has even glanced across the borders of &ldquo;The Undiscovered
Country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s discoveries of new kinds of
characters, probably the most popular is his invention of the
British soldier in India.&nbsp; He avers that he &ldquo;loves
that very strong man, Thomas Atkins&rdquo;; but his affection has
not blinded him to the faults of the beloved.&nbsp; Mr. Atkins
drinks too much, is too careless a gallant in love, has been
educated either too much or too little, and has other faults,
partly due, apparently, to recent military organisation, partly
to the feverish and unsettled state of the civilised world.&nbsp;
But he is still brave, when he is well led; still loyal, above
all, to his &ldquo;trusty chum.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every Englishman
must hope that, if Terence Mulvaney did not take the city of
Lungtung Pen as described, yet he is ready, and willing so to
take it.&nbsp; Mr. Mulvaney is as humorous as Micky Free, but
more melancholy and more truculent.&nbsp; He has, perhaps,
&ldquo;won his way to the mythical&rdquo; already, and is not so
much a soldier, as an incarnation, not of Krishna, but of many
soldierly qualities.&nbsp; On the other hand, Private Ortheris,
especially in his frenzy, seems to shew all the truth, and much
more than the life of, a photograph.&nbsp; Such, we presume, is
the soldier, and such are his experiences and temptations and
repentance.&nbsp; But nobody ever dreamed of telling us all this,
till Mr. Kipling came.&nbsp; As for the soldier in action, the
&ldquo;Taking of Lungtung Pen,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Drums of the
Fore and Aft,&rdquo; and that other tale of the battle with the
Pathans in the gorge, are among the good fights of fiction.&nbsp;
They stir the spirit, and they should be distributed (in
addition, of course, to the &ldquo;Soldier&rsquo;s Pocket
Book&rdquo;) in the ranks of the British army.&nbsp; Mr. Kipling
is as well informed about the soldier&rsquo;s women-kind as about
the soldier: about Dinah Shadd as about Terence Mulvaney.&nbsp;
Lever never instructed us on these matters: Micky Free, if he
loves, rides away; but Terence Mulvaney is true to his old
woman.&nbsp; Gallant, loyal, reckless, vain, swaggering, and
tender-hearted, Terence Mulvaney, if there were enough of him,
&ldquo;would take St. Petersburg in his drawers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Can
we be too grateful to an author who has extended, as Mr. Kipling
in his military sketches has extended, the frontiers of our
knowledge and sympathy?</p>
<p>It is a mere question of individual taste; but, for my own
part, had I to make a small selection from Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s
tales, I would include more of his studies in Black than in
White, and many of his excursions beyond the probable and
natural.&nbsp; It is difficult to have one special favourite in
this kind; but perhaps the story of the two English adventurers
among the freemasons of unknown Kafiristan (in the &ldquo;Phantom
Rickshaw&rdquo;) would take a very high place.&nbsp; The
gas-heated air of the Indian newspaper office is so real, and
into it comes a wanderer who has seen new faces of death, and who
carries with him a head that has worn a royal crown.&nbsp; The
contrasts are of brutal force; the legend is among the best of
such strange fancies.&nbsp; Then there is, in the same volume,
&ldquo;The Strange Ride of Morrowbie Jukes,&rdquo; the most
dreadful nightmare of the most awful Bunker in the realms of
fancy.&nbsp; This is a very early work; if nothing else of Mr.
Kipling&rsquo;s existed, his memory might live by it, as does the
memory of the American Irishman by the &ldquo;Diamond
Lens.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sham magic of &ldquo;In the House of
Suddhu&rdquo; is as terrible as true necromancy could be, and I
have a <i>faiblesse</i> for the &ldquo;Bisara of
Pooree.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Gate of the Hundred
Sorrows&rdquo; is a realistic version of &ldquo;The English Opium
Eater,&rdquo; and more powerful by dint of less rhetoric.&nbsp;
As for the sketches of native life&mdash;for example, &ldquo;On
the City Wall&rdquo;&mdash;to English readers they are no less
than revelations.&nbsp; They testify, more even than the military
stories, to the author&rsquo;s swift and certain vision, his
certainty in his effects.&nbsp; In brief, Mr. Kipling has
conquered worlds, of which, as it were, we knew not the
existence.</p>
<p>His faults are so conspicuous, so much on the surface, that
they hardly need to be named.&nbsp; They are curiously visible to
some readers who are blind to his merits.&nbsp; There is a false
air of hardness (quite in contradiction to the sentiment in his
tales of childish life); there is a knowing air; there are
mannerisms, such as &ldquo;But that is another story&rdquo;;
there is a display of slang; there is the too obtrusive knocking
of the nail on the head.&nbsp; Everybody can mark these errors; a
few cannot overcome their antipathy, and so lose a great deal of
pleasure.</p>
<p>It is impossible to guess how Mr. Kipling will fare if he
ventures on one of the usual novels, of the orthodox
length.&nbsp; Few men have succeeded both in the <i>conte</i> and
the novel.&nbsp; Mr. Bret Harte is limited to the <i>conte</i>;
M. Guy de Maupassant is probably at his best in it.&nbsp; Scott
wrote but three or four short tales, and only one of these is a
masterpiece.&nbsp; Poe never attempted a novel.&nbsp; Hawthorne
is almost alone in his command of both kinds.&nbsp; We can live
only in the hope that Mr. Kipling, so skilled in so many species
of the <i>conte</i>, so vigorous in so many kinds of verse, will
also be triumphant in the novel: though it seems unlikely that
its scene can be in England, and though it is certain that a
writer who so cuts to the quick will not be happy with the
novel&rsquo;s almost inevitable &ldquo;padding.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Kipling&rsquo;s longest effort, &ldquo;The Light which
Failed,&rdquo; can, perhaps, hardly be considered a test or
touchstone of his powers as a novelist.&nbsp; The central
interest is not powerful enough; the characters are not so
sympathetic, as are the interest and the characters of his short
pieces.&nbsp; Many of these persons we have met so often that
they are not mere passing acquaintances, but already find in us
the loyalty due to old friends.</p>

and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
